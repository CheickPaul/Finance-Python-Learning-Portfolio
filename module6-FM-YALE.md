# Investment Banks Introduction  

## 1. Definition and Role  
- Investment banks are **financial intermediaries** that manage investments for individuals and institutions.  
- Unlike commercial banks, they **do not take deposits** but specialize in capital markets.  
- They provide services such as **advisory, underwriting, trading, and asset management**.  

## 2. Evolution of Investing  
- Historically, investing was more of an **individual activity**.  
- Over time, it became dominated by **intermediaries** (banks, mutual funds, ETFs, money managers).  
- These intermediaries provide access to markets, diversification, and professional expertise.  

## 3. Types of Intermediaries  
- **Mutual fund managers**: pool money from investors to buy diversified portfolios.  
- **ETF managers**: offer exchange-traded funds that replicate indexes or strategies.  
- **Pension funds & institutional investors**: manage retirement and large-scale institutional assets.  

## 4. Distinction from Commercial Banks  
- Commercial banks: take deposits, make loans, operate locally in communities.  
- Investment banks: operate globally, focus on **capital raising, securities issuance, and trading**.  
- Reputation and credibility are essential for their function.  

## 5. Key Insight  
- Investment banks and money managers act as **gateways between investors and markets**.  
- They reduce barriers for individuals, provide trust and efficiency, and enable large-scale capital allocation.

# The Underwriting Process  

## 1. Definition and Role  
- **Underwriting = issuance of shares or corporate debt.**  
- Investment banks act like consulting firms **with resources and capital access**.  
- They put their **reputation** behind the issue through **due diligence** and certification.  
- Purpose: reduce **moral hazard** and protect investors.  

## 2. Moral Hazard Problem  
- Managers might issue new shares when earnings look high but are unsustainable.  
- Risk: investors buy overpriced shares.  
- Investment banks mitigate this by checking legitimacy and certifying the issue.  
- If mispriced, banks lose market share and credibility.  

## 3. Pricing the Offering  
- Banks must balance between issuers and investors:  
  - **Too low** → issuers unhappy (raise less money).  
  - **Too high** → investors unhappy (lose value quickly).  
- Correct pricing is crucial for reputation and future business.  

## 4. Types of Offerings  
- **Bought deal**: investment bank buys shares from issuer, then resells them for profit.  
- **Best efforts**: bank only tries to sell at agreed price; no guarantee.  

## 5. Syndicate Formation  
- Large issues require multiple banks.  
- A **syndicate** is formed, designating a lead manager.  
- Built on **trust, connections, and reputation**.  
- Investment bankers cultivate elite, credible images to inspire confidence.  

## 6. Legal and Procedural Steps  
- **Pre-filing period**: issuer consults the bank.  
- **Syndicate agreement**: underwriters collaborate.  
- **Registration statement** filed with SEC.  
- **Cooling-off period**: preliminary prospectus (“Red Herring”) distributed, outlining risks.  
- Final **underwriting agreement** fixes offering price and terms.  

## 7. Distribution and Dealers  
- Dealers purchase from underwriters at a discount.  
- Effective date = official launch of the issue.  
- Initial offering price is the same for all buyers.  

## 8. Aftermarket Stabilization  
- Underwriters may support the price after issuance.  
- Goal: avoid panic or backlash if the price drops sharply.  
- **Stabilization** is legally allowed by SEC, despite looking like manipulation.  
- Slight **underpricing** is common to create positive investor sentiment post-issue.  

## 9. Key Insight  
- Underwriting ensures companies can raise funds while protecting investors.  
- The process blends **advice, certification, pricing, distribution, and stabilization**.  
- Reputation and trust are central to the entire mechanism.

## [Lesson – The Underwriting Process]
#### Summary
1. Underwriting = issuance of securities (equity or corporate debt) with the support of an investment bank.  
2. The bank acts as both advisor and guarantor of trust.  
3. It conducts due diligence to check legitimacy and reduce moral hazard.  
4. Pricing balance is critical: too low = company unhappy, too high = investors unhappy.  
5. Deal types: bought deal (bank buys all shares) vs. best efforts (bank only tries to sell).  
6. Large offerings require a syndicate of banks coordinated by a lead manager.  
7. Legal steps: pre-filing → SEC filing → cooling-off period with “Red Herring” → due diligence meeting → effective date.  
8. Underwriting spread = bank’s compensation (price difference).  
9. Banks often stabilize aftermarket prices to protect reputation.  
10. IPOs are often slightly underpriced to create positive momentum and investor confidence.  

#### Reflection
1. Companies use banks because investors trust the **bank’s credibility** more than the company’s own numbers.  
2. Underwriters reduce **moral hazard** by investigating the true financials.  
3. **Pricing balance** matters: too low → less money, too high → loss of trust.  
4. **Bought deal** = guaranteed money for the company. **Best efforts** = company keeps the risk.  
5. Syndicates pool **networks, clients, and distribution power** to handle large offerings.  
6. The **cooling-off period** lets investors review the preliminary prospectus (“Red Herring”) before the IPO.  
7. **Underpricing IPOs** builds investor confidence by creating short-term price jumps.  
   - Trading implication: possible **IPO flipping strategy**, using the momentum of early excitement.  
8. Banks may **buy back shares** to stabilize the price and protect their reputation.  
9. **Stabilization** is seen as manipulation by some, but the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) allows it to avoid panic.  
10. Reputation is central: just as underwriters rely on credibility, **traders and funds also depend on trust and accurate risk management**.
