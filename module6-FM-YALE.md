# Investment Banks Introduction  

## 1. Definition and Role  
- Investment banks are **financial intermediaries** that manage investments for individuals and institutions.  
- Unlike commercial banks, they **do not take deposits** but specialize in capital markets.  
- They provide services such as **advisory, underwriting, trading, and asset management**.  

## 2. Evolution of Investing  
- Historically, investing was more of an **individual activity**.  
- Over time, it became dominated by **intermediaries** (banks, mutual funds, ETFs, money managers).  
- These intermediaries provide access to markets, diversification, and professional expertise.  

## 3. Types of Intermediaries  
- **Mutual fund managers**: pool money from investors to buy diversified portfolios.  
- **ETF managers**: offer exchange-traded funds that replicate indexes or strategies.  
- **Pension funds & institutional investors**: manage retirement and large-scale institutional assets.  

## 4. Distinction from Commercial Banks  
- Commercial banks: take deposits, make loans, operate locally in communities.  
- Investment banks: operate globally, focus on **capital raising, securities issuance, and trading**.  
- Reputation and credibility are essential for their function.  

## 5. Key Insight  
- Investment banks and money managers act as **gateways between investors and markets**.  
- They reduce barriers for individuals, provide trust and efficiency, and enable large-scale capital allocation.

# The Underwriting Process  

## 1. Definition and Role  
- **Underwriting = issuance of shares or corporate debt.**  
- Investment banks act like consulting firms **with resources and capital access**.  
- They put their **reputation** behind the issue through **due diligence** and certification.  
- Purpose: reduce **moral hazard** and protect investors.  

## 2. Moral Hazard Problem  
- Managers might issue new shares when earnings look high but are unsustainable.  
- Risk: investors buy overpriced shares.  
- Investment banks mitigate this by checking legitimacy and certifying the issue.  
- If mispriced, banks lose market share and credibility.  

## 3. Pricing the Offering  
- Banks must balance between issuers and investors:  
  - **Too low** → issuers unhappy (raise less money).  
  - **Too high** → investors unhappy (lose value quickly).  
- Correct pricing is crucial for reputation and future business.  

## 4. Types of Offerings  
- **Bought deal**: investment bank buys shares from issuer, then resells them for profit.  
- **Best efforts**: bank only tries to sell at agreed price; no guarantee.  

## 5. Syndicate Formation  
- Large issues require multiple banks.  
- A **syndicate** is formed, designating a lead manager.  
- Built on **trust, connections, and reputation**.  
- Investment bankers cultivate elite, credible images to inspire confidence.  

## 6. Legal and Procedural Steps  
- **Pre-filing period**: issuer consults the bank.  
- **Syndicate agreement**: underwriters collaborate.  
- **Registration statement** filed with SEC.  
- **Cooling-off period**: preliminary prospectus (“Red Herring”) distributed, outlining risks.  
- Final **underwriting agreement** fixes offering price and terms.  

## 7. Distribution and Dealers  
- Dealers purchase from underwriters at a discount.  
- Effective date = official launch of the issue.  
- Initial offering price is the same for all buyers.  

## 8. Aftermarket Stabilization  
- Underwriters may support the price after issuance.  
- Goal: avoid panic or backlash if the price drops sharply.  
- **Stabilization** is legally allowed by SEC, despite looking like manipulation.  
- Slight **underpricing** is common to create positive investor sentiment post-issue.  

## 9. Key Insight  
- Underwriting ensures companies can raise funds while protecting investors.  
- The process blends **advice, certification, pricing, distribution, and stabilization**.  
- Reputation and trust are central to the entire mechanism.  
```
## [Lesson – The Underwriting Process]
#### Summary
1. Underwriting = issuance of securities (equity or corporate debt) with the support of an investment bank.  
2. The bank acts as both advisor and guarantor of trust.  
3. It conducts due diligence to check legitimacy and reduce moral hazard.  
4. Pricing balance is critical: too low = company unhappy, too high = investors unhappy.  
5. Deal types: bought deal (bank buys all shares) vs. best efforts (bank only tries to sell).  
6. Large offerings require a syndicate of banks coordinated by a lead manager.  
7. Legal steps: pre-filing → SEC filing → cooling-off period with “Red Herring” → due diligence meeting → effective date.  
8. Underwriting spread = bank’s compensation (price difference).  
9. Banks often stabilize aftermarket prices to protect reputation.  
10. IPOs are often slightly underpriced to create positive momentum and investor confidence.  

#### Reflection
1. Companies use banks because investors trust the **bank’s credibility** more than the company’s own numbers.  
2. Underwriters reduce **moral hazard** by investigating the true financials.  
3. **Pricing balance** matters: too low → less money, too high → loss of trust.  
4. **Bought deal** = guaranteed money for the company. **Best efforts** = company keeps the risk.  
5. Syndicates pool **networks, clients, and distribution power** to handle large offerings.  
6. The **cooling-off period** lets investors review the preliminary prospectus (“Red Herring”) before the IPO.  
7. **Underpricing IPOs** builds investor confidence by creating short-term price jumps.  
   - Trading implication: possible **IPO flipping strategy**, using the momentum of early excitement.  
8. Banks may **buy back shares** to stabilize the price and protect their reputation.  
9. **Stabilization** is seen as manipulation by some, but the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) allows it to avoid panic.  
10. Reputation is central: just as underwriters rely on credibility, **traders and funds also depend on trust and accurate risk management**.



# [IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)]

## 1. Definition

* **IPO = Initial Public Offering**: first public sale of a company’s shares.
* Before an IPO, shares can be **privately placed** (not listed, traded rarely).
* Example: Case-Schiller Weiss Inc. (private, never listed).

## 2. Regulation and SEC’s Role

* **SEC** regulates IPOs to prevent **manipulation** and **distortion**.
* It does **not** evaluate the business potential of companies (e.g., Facebook).

## 3. Underpricing Phenomenon

* IPOs are often **deliberately underpriced**.
* Typical effect: **immediate price jump** in the aftermarket (e.g., \$25 → \$30).
* Rationale: create **demand**, ensure a **successful sale**, build reputation.
* Underwriters’ defense: “This is how it works, otherwise you would get less.”

## 4. Access to IPOs

* Hard for small investors to participate in IPOs.
* Shares are allocated to **preferred clients**.
* Reason: avoid “flippers” (young investors who sell immediately for quick gains).

## 5. Long-Term Performance

* Study by **Jay Ritter (1991)**:

  * Average **+16%** on the first trading day.
  * Over the long run: **prices decline**, underperformance after a few years.
* Brokers prefer “stable” investors (e.g., older, less active clients).

## 6. Manipulation and Ethics

* IPOs involve a form of **manipulation**, but generally seen as “acceptable.”
* Reality: financial markets are full of **tricks and framing strategies**.
* Ethical standards matter, but underpricing is considered a normal practice.

## 7. Impresario Hypothesis

* Analogy with **concert impresarios**:

  * Keep ticket prices **low** to generate buzz and enthusiasm.
  * Goal: **sold-out venues, long lines, media attention**.
  * If prices are too high → empty halls, no excitement.
* Conclusion: **underpricing is a marketing tool** to create long-term demand.

(Reflection)

I do not consider IPOs as manipulation: since the SEC allows underpricing, it should be seen as a market rule. In fact, I interpret it as a marketing principle, similar to discounting a product at launch to create momentum.

For me, the exclusion of retail investors is clearly an entry barrier. It reflects how access in financial markets is often stratified, favoring institutional clients.

From an investment perspective, I believe both horizons are relevant: short term for the initial pop, and long term for fundamentals. However, as a short-term trader, I would personally prioritize the first-day performance.

Regarding the impresario analogy, just like a concert manager keeps ticket prices low to fill the hall and generate hype, underwriters underprice IPOs to create buzz and long-term reputation. This shows that finance is not only about valuation, but also about perception and psychology.

If I were on an Equity Capital Markets desk, I would feel enthusiastic about orchestrating IPOs, even knowing about their “game-like” mechanisms.

# [Goldman Sachs and John Whitehead]

## 1. Charles Ellis & *The Partnership*

* Charles Ellis, member of the Yale Corporation, wrote *The Partnership* just before the financial crisis.
* The book focused on **Goldman Sachs**, then the most esteemed and successful investment bank in the U.S.
* Tone: largely admiring, though sometimes critical.

## 2. The Original Goldman Sachs Culture

* **Primary objective: making money** — no exceptions.
* Actions were never done for prestige alone (though prestige indirectly supported business).
* **Prestigious clients** were often charged the most.
* Core values:

  * **Absolute loyalty** to the partnership.
  * **Personal anonymity**: employees represent Goldman Sachs, not themselves.
* Operated like a **family**, similar to traditions understood in Chinese, Arab, and old European contexts.

## 3. John Whitehead’s Principles (1970s)

* John Whitehead, as chairman, introduced more **idealistic and moral principles**:

  * Priority: **money for the client first** (before the firm).
  * **Core assets**: people, capital, and reputation.
  * Banking is about **trust** and **reputation building**.
  * Emphasis on **excellence, creativity, and imagination**.
  * Culture of **“talk to the boss”**: junior employees expected to speak directly to CEOs, not assistants.
  * **Respect for individuals** and client satisfaction as a non-negotiable.

## 4. Later Decline

* Over time, Goldman drifted away from “client first.”
* Example: **\$5 billion settlement** for dishonest mortgage security marketing.
* Loss of the **partnership structure** reduced its sense of family.
* Still, many **talented and ethical individuals** remain at the firm.

---
(reflection)

Goldman’s culture (money first) :

I believe “money first” can damage client trust. Clients prefer a win–win strategy, not just profit for the firm.

Personally, I would not feel comfortable in such a culture. A company focused solely on money spends too much time and money managing frustrated clients, and becomes weak if new competition arises.

Client-first principle :

I agree with Whitehead’s client-first approach.

To me, trading is a fair game: the more participants, the higher the chances of success for the best players.

Talking to the boss :

I see Whitehead’s rule as empowering and bold.

He was right, because in 2025 most well-established and successful companies apply this principle — aiming for direct access to decision-makers.

Trust and reputation :

I think reputation is as important as revenue.

Reputation attracts talent: people want to join and stay in a company with strong values.

Personal takeaway

The border between proprietary trading and agency trading is very thin.

Reasons:

They often share the same infrastructure (desks, systems, analysts, data).

Proprietary trading is sometimes financed through leverage or funding linked to clients, making the capital indirectly connected.

There are frequent conflicts of interest, since a bank can act both as a counterparty and as a client’s service provider.

Even proprietary trading firms should therefore adopt a client-first policy, because:

It builds trust, reputation, and long-term relationships.

Losses or misconduct in prop trading inevitably affect client perception and confidence.

Profitability and ethics are not contradictory prioritizing clients can ultimately attract more business and more capital.

Parfait, voici la version finale prête pour ton **README GitHub** sur les **Rating Agencies** :

# [Rating Agencies]

## 1. Definition and Role

* Alternative to trusting investment bankers: rating agencies publish information openly instead of keeping it secret for favored clients.
* Purpose: evaluate **integrity and creditworthiness** of companies and securities.

## 2. Historical Origins

* **1860**: Henry Varnum Poor publishes *History of Railways and Canals in the US* → early form of corporate evaluation.
* **1909**: John L. Moody founds **Moody’s Investor Services**, the first true rating agency.
* **1916**: Poor’s merges with Standard Statistics → **Standard & Poor’s** (S\&P).

## 3. The Rating System

* Inspired by university grading (A, B, C, D).
* Best rating: **AAA (Triple-A)**.
* Scale includes **B’s, C’s, D’s**, with lower ratings signaling higher risk.
* Categories:

  * **Investment Grade**: AAA, AA, A, BBB (safe for institutional investors).
  * **Speculative Grade (Junk Bonds)**: BB, B, CCC, CC, C (higher risk, higher yield).
  * **Default**: D (issuer has failed to pay).

## 4. Moody’s Mission

* Described in *The Long Road Home* (1933).
* Motivated by:

  * Desire for truth and transparency.
  * Publishing critiques to expose corporate misconduct.
* Moody’s manuals became widely sold references for investors.

## 5. Conflict of Interest Problem

* **Original principle**: agencies did **not** accept money from issuers (to avoid bias).
* **Since 1970s**:

  * Complexity of securities → agencies began charging issuers directly.
  * Became a highly profitable business (especially with structured products).

## 6. The 2000s Crisis Example

* Shown in *The Big Short*:

  * Agencies gave inflated ratings without verifying underlying risks.
  * Competitive pressure: *“If we don’t rate, competitors will.”*
  * Contributed to the housing and financial crisis.

## 7. Reforms and Today’s Practices

* Post-crisis: stricter **regulations** and need to restore **reputation**.
* Agencies still **charge issuers**, but apply more rigorous standards.
* Remain central to global finance (corporate bonds, sovereign debt, structured finance).

  
 **Debt = total stock owed.**

**Debt-to-GDP = how large the debt is compared to the economy.**

**Deficit/Surplus = yearly flow that pushes debt up or down.**
  
 ## (Reflection)

* **France**: Public debt reached about **113% of GDP** in 2024, with a fiscal deficit of **–5.8% of GDP** the same year. Growth remains modest, and Fitch downgraded the sovereign rating to **A+** in September 2025, highlighting concerns over fiscal sustainability.

* **Denmark**: Public debt stood at only **31% of GDP** in 2024, while the government posted a **+4.5% budget surplus**. Strong fiscal discipline and long-term pension reforms underpin its **AAA** rating and high financial credibility.

Veux-tu que j’ajoute une **dernière phrase comparative** (France vs Denmark) pour conclure la réflexion ?

Makes sense — the history is full of twists. Let me simplify the **timeline of reforms** for you, so you have a clean mental map (and we can even add it as a timeline graphic later if you want):

---

# [Glass–Steagall Timeline (Simplified)]

1. **1929 Crash**

   * Stock market collapses.
   * Blame: banks mixed **commercial banking** (deposits, loans) with **investment banking** (speculation, securities).

2. **1933 – Glass–Steagall Act**

   * Separates **commercial banks** from **investment banks**.
   * Creates **FDIC** (deposit insurance).
   * Example: **JP Morgan stays commercial** → partners create **Morgan Stanley (1935)** as investment bank.

3. **1933–1990s – Separation era**

   * U.S. banks = strict separation.
   * Europe & Canada = **universal banking** (no separation).
   * Over time, U.S. banks complain they are **less competitive**.

4. **1999 – Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act**

   * Signed by President Clinton.
   * **Repeals Glass–Steagall** → banks can combine commercial, investment, and insurance.
   * Triggers mega-mergers: Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, UBS, Credit Suisse, etc.

5. **2007–2008 Financial Crisis**

   * Critics say repeal of Glass–Steagall encouraged **too much risk-taking**.

6. **2010 – Dodd–Frank Act**

   * Reform after the crisis.
   * Did **not** restore Glass–Steagall.
   * Introduces **Volcker Rule**:

     * Banks can underwrite securities.
     * But cannot do **proprietary trading** (trading their own money in risky bets).

---

So in short:

* **1933–1999** = Separation (Glass–Steagall).
* **1999** = Repeal (Gramm–Leach–Bliley).
* **2010** = Volcker Rule (partial restriction after crisis).

  
**(reflection) Where to Go if You Want to Trade**

When considering a career in trading, it is important to distinguish between different types of institutions:

* **Investment Banks (Securities Divisions)**:

  * Provide strong training and global prestige (e.g., GS, MS, JPM, Citi, BofA).
  * Offer access to sales & trading desks.
  * Advisory roles (bond issuance, DCM) are distinct and less trading-focused.

* **Prop Trading Firms / Market Makers** (Jane Street, Optiver, IMC, SIG, Citadel Securities):

  * Specialize in proprietary trading with their own capital.
  * Highly meritocratic, with strong emphasis on math and coding skills.
  * Potentially higher compensation compared to banks, but very competitive.

* **Hedge Funds** (Citadel, Millennium, Point72, DE Shaw):

  * Focus on advanced and specialized strategies (macro, quant, fixed income, credit).
  * Typically recruit professionals with prior trading experience.

* **Universal Banks in Denmark/Europe** (Danske Bank Markets, Nordea Markets, BNP Paribas, Barclays):

  * Easier entry point in the Nordic region.
  * Strong in **covered bonds and Nordic rates**.
  
**Conclusion:**
The choice of institution shapes the type of trading exposure: **investment banks** provide structured training and prestige, **prop firms** offer pure performance-driven trading, **hedge funds** demand specialization, while **universal banks in Europe** provide accessible entry routes into fixed income trading.

# [Net Worth of the United States]

## 1. Professional Money Managers

* Different from **investment bankers** and **commercial bankers**.
* Their role: **manage other people’s money** by investing directly in markets (stocks, bonds, etc.).
* Comparable to commercial banks but with a direct focus on financial markets.

## 2. Total Assets of US Households

* **Total: \$101 trillion** (Federal Reserve, Table B-101).
* Average: **\$270,000 per person**.
* Typical family of four: **≈ \$1 million in assets**.
* However: **large inequality** → the median is much lower, bottom 10% ≈ zero.

## 3. Composition of Assets

* **Real estate (homes):** ≈ \$25 trillion (≈ 25%).
* **Pension funds:** ≈ \$20 trillion.
* **Equity in non-corporate business:** ≈ \$10 trillion.
* **Stocks (directly owned):** ≈ \$13 trillion.
* **Bank deposits:** ≈ \$10 trillion.
* **Mutual funds:** ≈ \$8 trillion.
* **Consumer durables** (cars, furniture, etc.): ≈ \$5 trillion.
* **Government bonds (direct holdings):** very small.
* **Corporate bonds (direct holdings):** only ≈ \$296 billion.
* **Municipal bonds:** more common among wealthy households (tax advantages).
* **Life insurance (cash value):** ≈ \$1 trillion.

## 4. Liabilities

* **Mortgages:** ≈ \$10 trillion.
* **Consumer credit** (credit cards, installment loans): ≈ \$3.5 trillion.
* **Other bank loans (excluding mortgages):** ≈ \$1.5 trillion.
* **Total liabilities:** ≈ \$14.5 trillion.

## 5. Net Worth

* **Assets (\$101 trillion) – Liabilities (\$14.5 trillion) = \$86 trillion**.
* The “\$1 million per household” figure is based on assets only; adjusting for debt, net worth is lower.

(reflection)
Parfait 👍 — voici une **proposition de section “Reflection”** que tu pourras insérer dans ton README. Elle reprend **la Phase 1 (3 Pillars)** et fait le lien avec le modèle américain (net worth des ménages) :

---

## (Reflection)

The **U.S. household model** shows that most of the average net worth comes from three pillars: **real estate, pension funds, and financial investments**. This inspires a similar approach for long-term wealth building as a salaried worker.

**Phase 1 – The 3 Pillars**

1. **Emergency Fund** → build security first, covering 6 months of expenses.
2. **Money Managers / ETFs** → contribute regularly (e.g. €500/month) into diversified funds, reproducing the U.S. logic of pension and mutual fund accumulation.
3. **Real Estate** → secure a primary residence and possibly one rental property, echoing the fact that \~25% of U.S. household assets are in housing.

This structure mirrors the American balance sheet:

* **Homes + pensions = backbone of net worth**,
* **Financial investments = compounding growth**,
* **Liquidity reserves = resilience against shocks**.

**Tax deferral is key**: compounding works best when you minimize interim taxation.

ETFs (accumulating) and business ownership (retained earnings) allow for tax deferral.

Real estate is less flexible, since rent is taxed annually, but it remains a powerful inflation hedge and leverage tool.

# [Advisors]

## 1. Choosing a Financial Advisor

* Seek **referrals** and **references** from trusted people.
* Look for certification bodies (e.g., **National Association of Personal Financial Advisers**) though not perfect, they provide some quality control.
* Important: ensure the advisor genuinely has **your interests at heart**.

## 2. Human vs. Automated Advice

* Advisors often ask similar questions: **risk tolerance, goals, age**.
* **Robo-advisors** can provide standardized answers, useful for basic guidance.
* But for **major life decisions**, most people want a **human connection**.
* Like teaching: online tools help, but **real human motivation and trust** remain essential.

## 3. Costs and Accessibility

* Good advisors are expensive (**\$300/hour** typical fee-only rate).
* Lower-income households often **cannot afford professional advice**.
* Shiller advocates for **government subsidies** or **philanthropic support** to make financial advice accessible.

## 4. Regulation and Support Structures

* **Dodd-Frank Act** created institutions like the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**.
* CFPB allows consumers to file complaints but is **not equivalent to having a personal advisor or lawyer**.
* Non-profits and charities sometimes fill this gap, but they are often **overwhelmed**.

## 5. Role of Advice in Financial Crises

* Pre-2008, many low-income households bought homes with **adjustable-rate mortgages**, relying on banks to judge affordability.
* Banks had little incentive since they sold mortgages on.
* **Rating agencies** did not raise alarms.
* Many households could have avoided hardship if they had received **basic financial advice** (e.g., warnings about mortgage risks).

## 6. Advice Beyond Portfolio Management

* Low-income individuals don’t always need stock-picking advice.
* They need **coaching**, like a **therapist for finances**:

  * Encouragement to **save regularly**.
  * Awareness of risks (job loss, emergencies).
  * Realistic assessment of affordability.

## 7. Citizens Advice Bureaus

* In the **UK**, Citizens Advice Bureaus provide **free financial guidance** (covering issues from mortgages to family disputes).
* Focus is on **low-income households** but open to everyone.
* Some exist in the **U.S.**, but not widespread.

Parfait, voici une **section “Reflection – Advisors”** en Markdown, avec la logique pro et les bons contacts au Danemark intégrés. Tu pourras la mettre dans ton GitHub :

## (Reflection) 

* It is possible to **start directly with a money manager** if the main goal is to invest capital efficiently from day one. The money manager will build and execute a portfolio strategy but may not fully address broader financial planning (debt, taxes, retirement, inheritance).

* After **2–3 years**, meeting a **financial advisor** is valuable for a **global review**:

  * Ensure investments are aligned with long-term life goals.
  * Verify that portfolio management fees are reasonable.
  * Obtain an **independent second opinion** on the money manager’s performance.
  * Adjust the strategy if personal circumstances or risk tolerance have changed.

* This sequence (money manager first, advisor later) can be an efficient strategy for someone who wants to start investing immediately but still wants a **holistic financial health check** later.

### Advisors in Denmark

* **F10 Finans (via IDA)**

  * Offers personal financial advice (mortgage, pension, global finance).
  * Cost: \~DKK 3,500 (non-members) or \~DKK 1,500 (IDA members) for a one-off financial check.

* **UBS Wealth Management (Denmark)**

  * Wealth management and tailored investment services for individuals and families.

* **Howden Danmark**

  * Corporate-focused advisory (banking, payments, cost diagnostics), also relevant for entrepreneurs.

* **Independent advisors (tax & finance for expats)**

  * Typical hourly rates: **DKK 600–1,200/hour**.
  * Useful for international tax, pensions, and cross-border planning.

Here’s the full English translation of your text, keeping the structure and clarity:

---

# [Mutual Funds, Closed-End Funds, and ETFs]

## 1. Mutual Funds (Open-End)

* **How it works**: you give your money directly to the fund (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard).
* **Buying/Selling**: only once per day, at the **closing price (4:00 pm)**.
* **Redemption**: you can get your money back directly from the fund, at its real value (*NAV* = Net Asset Value).
* **Fees**: generally higher (manager salaries, marketing, etc.).
* **Price vs Real Value (NAV)**: always **equal** to the real value of the assets.

👉 Example: you invest €10,000 in a U.S. equity mutual fund → every evening at 4:00 pm, the value of your share is calculated, and you can withdraw exactly that amount.

---

## 2. Closed-End Funds

* **How it works**: the fund does an **IPO** (initial public offering) and sells a fixed number of shares.
* **Buying/Selling**: happens on the stock exchange, like any regular stock, **throughout the day**.
* **Redemption**: you cannot ask the fund directly for your money back. You must **sell your shares to another investor**.
* **Fees**: variable.
* **Price vs Real Value (NAV)**: can be **lower (discount)** or **higher (premium)** than the real value of the assets, depending on supply and demand.

👉 Example: if the fund holds stocks worth €100 per share, it might still trade on the exchange at €90 (discount) or €110 (premium).

---

## 3. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

* **How it works**: similar to a mutual fund, but it is **traded on an exchange** like a stock.
* **Buying/Selling**: possible **throughout the day**.
* **Redemption**: as a retail investor, you sell your shares on the market. But large players called **authorized participants (APs)** perform **arbitrage**:

  * if the ETF price > real value → they create more shares → the price goes down.
  * if the ETF price < real value → they buy and cancel shares → the price goes up.
* **Fees**: very low (often < 0.20% per year).
* **Price vs Real Value (NAV)**: stays **close to the real value**, thanks to this arbitrage mechanism.

👉 Example: the SPDR ETF on the **S\&P 500** → you can buy/sell it all day on the stock exchange. The price always stays very close to the real value of the index.

## Visual Summary

| Characteristic      | Mutual Fund (Open-End) | Closed-End Fund          | ETF                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Buying/Selling      | 1x/day (4 pm, NAV)     | All day on exchange      | All day on exchange                           |
| Direct Redemption   | Yes (at NAV)           | No (must sell on market) | Not direct (sold on market, arbitrage by APs) |
| Price vs Real Value | Always = NAV           | Can be + or – than NAV   | ≈ NAV (corrected by arbitrage)                |
| Fees                | Higher                 | Variable                 | Very low                                      |

---

👉 In short:

* **Mutual Fund** = simple, safe, but rigid (1 trade/day, higher fees).
* **Closed-End Fund** = flexible (exchange-traded), but price often disconnected from real value.
* **ETF** = combines the best of both: flexible + low fees + price aligned with real value.

# [Brokers and Dealers]

## 1. Definitions

* **Broker (Agent)**

  * Acts **on behalf of others** as an agent.
  * Earns a **commission** by matching buyers and sellers.
  * Example: Stockbroker finds a seller for a buyer and charges a commission.

* **Dealer (Principal)**

  * Always acts **for himself/herself**, not as agent.
  * Buys and sells securities **from own inventory**.
  * Makes money from a **markup** (bid–ask spread), not commission.
  * Example: If you sell to a dealer, they buy at a lower price; if you buy, they sell at a higher price.

* **Bid–Ask Spread**

  * Difference between buying (bid) and selling (ask) prices.
  * Represents the **cost of trading** in dealer markets.

* **Broker–Dealer**

  * A firm that can act as both broker and dealer (but **not in the same transaction**).
  * Dealers are often required by exchanges to execute a minimum quantity at posted prices.

* **Inter–Dealer Broker**

  * A broker that facilitates transactions **between dealers**.

---

## 2. Analogies

* **Antique Dealer**: Buys antiques, sets own selling price (no commission).

  * Bid–ask spreads are wide (higher costs, unique items).
* **Dealer Market**: Competition among dealers narrows spreads, reducing trading costs.
* **Real Estate**: Mostly brokers (agents). Few “dealers” because of tax treatment (capital gains taxed as ordinary income).

  * Exception: Germany has “Immobilienmakler” (dealer-like actors).

---

## 3. Good vs. Bad Broker Behavior

* **Good Behavior**: Representing clients’ interests, fair commission structures.

* **Bad Behavior – Churning**

  * Definition: Excessive trading in a client’s account **to generate commissions**, not to benefit the client.
  * Example: Broker frequently calls with “hot tips,” encouraging unnecessary trades.
  * Case: Robert Magnan (1999) → turnover rate of 11 (entire portfolio traded monthly). Clients needed \~50% returns just to cover costs.
  * SEC views this as **illegal and unethical**, punishable by lifetime ban.

* **Key Lesson**:

  * **Churning = illegal** (violates SEC rules).
  * To avoid: **Keep control of your trading account** (don’t give full discretion to brokers).

# [Exchanges]

## 1. Origins

* **First U.S. Exchange**: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), created in **1792**.
* Not the first in the world (Antwerp or Amsterdam likely came earlier).
* NYSE gained prestige as the "first mover."

## 2. Nasdaq (1971)

* **Created in 1971**: National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ).
* First **computerized market**, replacing the **pink sheets** (bid/ask quotes for unlisted, often dubious, small-cap firms).

## 3. Types of Markets

1. **NYSE** → prestigious, strict listing requirements (earnings, established history).
2. **Pink Sheets** → pre-Internet, mailed quotes of non-listed, often disreputable companies.
3. **Nasdaq Small Cap** → low-cap firms, riskier, “guy-next-door” types.
4. **Fourth Market** → direct trades between large institutions, outside exchanges.

## 4. Prestige and Regulation

* NYSE prestige is **fading**, Nasdaq became the **center of action** (innovative/adventurous firms).
* **National Best Bid Best Offer (NBBO)** system created by Congress to integrate markets.
* Stocks can be **delisted** if they lose investor confidence or break rules.

## 5. Information Technology & Exchanges

* Exchanges flourished in the **19th century**, supported by new info tech:

  * cheap pulp paper, typewriters, filing cabinets, carbon paper.
* These advances enabled the **Information Age** of finance.

## 6. Lending Exchanges (1926–1933)

* On the NYSE floor:

  * **Buy-Sell crowd** → trading stocks.
  * **Loan crowd** → borrowing stocks for short selling (with loan rate).
* After **1929 crash**, public blamed short sellers → lending exchanges lost legitimacy.

## 7. Listing Choice & Familiarity Bias

* Companies can **choose** which exchange to list on.
* **Research (Ning Zhu, Yale → Shanghai)**:

  * Investors prefer **locally listed stocks** (Shanghai → Shanghai firms).
  * Not due to info advantage, but **familiarity bias** → psychological comfort with “local” firms.
* Bias exists globally, not only in China.

# [Limit Order Book (LOB)]

## 1. Historical Context

* Example from **Island ECN (Electronic Communications Network)** about 20 years ago.
* **SEC** encouraged innovation and electronic trading by allowing ECNs as a separate category.
* Unique feature: **any investor**, not just dealers, could place visible orders in the book.

---

## 2. Book Structure

* **Bid** = buy order (price you want to pay).
* **Ask** = sell order (price you want to sell at).
* Orders are automatically sorted from best to worst price.
* Example:

  * Buy **100 shares at \$35.62**.
  * Sell **500 shares at \$35.63**.
* Mostly small orders → “amateur” market, though some dealers participated.

---

## 3. Execution Mechanics

* For **immediate execution** → place your order at the top of the book.
* Orders placed lower wait until a large trade (e.g., 1,000 shares) comes through.
* Dynamic flow: orders constantly appear and disappear within seconds.

---

## 4. Transition to NASDAQ

* Same principle as Island → now visible on **NASDAQ**.
* NASDAQ offers different **market depth levels**, but subscription is **expensive** → designed for professionals.
* Key difference: larger order sizes and dealer names (e.g., *arcx*) are shown.

---

## 5. Key Concept

* **Inside spread** = difference between best bid and best ask.
* The spread can vanish in a **fraction of a second**, reflecting high competition between buyers and sellers.

---

This module highlights **market microstructure**:

* Transparency via the order book.
* Importance of **queue position** in execution.
* Speed and intensity of electronic trading.

(reflection)
Got it — here’s the **English version** of your reflection in Markdown, ready for GitHub:

---

## Limit Order Book (LOB)


The **order book** is the electronic list of buy (**bids**) and sell (**asks**) orders for a financial asset, ranked by price and quantity.

* **Bid** → price buyers are willing to pay.
* **Ask** → price sellers are willing to accept.
* The book reflects the **real-time interaction of supply and demand**.

---

## Structure of the Book

Example (NASDAQ Level II – MSFT):

* **Bid side (buyers)**:

  * *arcx*: 100 shares @ **26.23**
  * *NSDQ*: 9192 shares @ **26.22**
  * *cinn*: 6600 shares @ **26.22**
  * ➝ Total available at **26.22** = **15,792 shares**

* **Ask side (sellers)**:

  * *NSDQ*: 2667 shares @ **26.23**
  * *cinn*: 8400 shares @ **26.24**
  * *arcx*: 4200 shares @ **26.24**

---

## Inside Market and Spread

* **Inside bid** = best buy price (here **26.23**).
* **Inside ask** = best sell price (here **26.23**).
* **Spread** = difference between bid and ask → can be zero in very liquid markets.

---

##  Market Depth

**Depth** refers to the volume available at different price levels beyond the inside market.

* Many large orders stacked at several levels = **deep and liquid market**.
* Few orders = **shallow market**, more volatile.

---

##  Uses of Market Depth

1. **Measure liquidity** → ability of the market to absorb large trades.
2. **Detect buy/sell pressure** → large order blocks (“walls”) often act as support or resistance.
3. **Anticipate volatility** → thin books allow sharp price moves.
4. **Manage slippage** → large orders may sweep through several price levels, increasing execution cost.

---

## Trading Applications

* **Scalping / Intraday**: enter or exit quickly by placing orders near the inside bid/ask.
* **Support / resistance levels**: spot large blocks of orders in the book.
* **Timing**: monitor how fast orders appear/disappear (order flow activity).
* **Risk management**: avoid sending oversized orders into a shallow book.

---

**In summary:**
The order book is a **real-time snapshot of supply and demand**.
It helps traders assess liquidity, identify pressure zones (support/resistance), and optimize execution to reduce slippage.


Parfait, voici ton **Markdown mis à jour** avec une **réflexion enrichie**, qui inclut le rôle du **market making en fixed income** (gouvernementaux vs corporate bonds) en plus des points sur le **coût caché** et le **lien HFT ↔ market makers** :

---

# [High Frequency Trading (HFT)]

## Key Points

* **Automation & speed**: algorithms execute trades in milliseconds or microseconds.
* **Colocation**: servers placed next to exchanges to minimize latency.
* **Ephemeral orders**: quotes that appear and disappear in the blink of an eye, invisible to humans.

---

## Advantages

* **Increased liquidity**: more quotes in the order book, tighter spreads.
* **Micro-time efficiency**: prices adjust instantly to new information (but only visible to machines).

---

## Disadvantages

* **Hidden cost**: billions of dollars per year are “siphoned” away from traditional investors by HFT firms.
* **Limited social utility**: a costly technological arms race with little benefit to the real economy.
* **Higher volatility**: can amplify market stress (e.g., Flash Crash 2010).

---

## Proposed Regulation

* **Batch Auctions**:

  * Aggregate orders and execute them every 1 to 10 seconds.
  * Turns the market into frequent mini-auctions.
  * Eliminates the millisecond advantage, making ultra-fast connections pointless.

---

## (Reflection)

* HFT makes the market “efficient at the millisecond level,” but this efficiency has **no real value** for most investors.
* The **hidden cost** is the most problematic aspect: HFT captures a slice of value from nearly every order. Repeated at scale, this represents **billions siphoned** from traditional portfolios each year.
* The link with **market makers** is central: HFT has largely replaced traditional market makers by becoming **electronic liquidity providers** (e.g., Citadel Securities, Virtu).

  * **Positive side**: tighter spreads, abundant liquidity.
  * **Negative side**: liquidity can be **phantom-like**, as quotes vanish within milliseconds, making execution harder for large institutional trades.
* Importantly, **not all market making is HFT**. In **fixed income markets**, two realities coexist:

  * **Government bonds (Treasuries, Bunds, Gilts, etc.)** → highly liquid, HFT-style quoting dominates.
  * **Corporate and municipal bonds, exotic credit derivatives** → liquidity is provided by banks and dealers through **RFQ systems** (MarketAxess, Tradeweb) or bilateral quotes. Here, **latency matters less**; the challenge is inventory risk and pricing models, not microseconds.
* In short:

  * HFT is the **modern face of market making** in liquid equities, futures, and government bonds.
  * In less liquid segments like corporates, munis, and exotics, **non-HFT market making** still plays a critical role, relying more on client relationships, credit analysis, and inventory management than on speed.
* Solutions like **batch auctions** directly target the imbalance in liquid markets by neutralizing the millisecond speed race, but they don’t erase the fundamental need for slower, relationship-driven market makers in fixed income.

---

# \[Payment for Order Flow]

## 1. Definition

* Practice where **brokers sell client orders** to third parties (often market makers or HFT firms).
* Instead of routing directly to an exchange, the broker **receives compensation** for order flow.
* Potential issue: **clients may not receive the best execution price**.

## 2. SEC Investigation (2000)

* The **SEC** considered banning PFOF.
* Concerns:

  * **Conflict of interest** between broker and client.
  * Investors may suffer from worse prices.
* Decision: **not banned**, because:

  * Could create **exchange monopolies**.
  * Impact on **competition and liquidity** uncertain.

## 3. Disclosure Rules

* PFOF is **allowed but must be disclosed**.
* Brokers are required to publish:

  * **Payments received** for order flow.
  * **Execution quality** statistics (are clients getting best prices?).

## 4. Order Types (Retail Investors)

* **Market Orders** → execution guaranteed, but risky in volatile markets (e.g., *Flash Crash 2010*).
* **Limit Orders** → executed only at or better than a set price, protecting from unfavorable fills.
* **Stop-Loss Orders** → automatic sell if price falls below a threshold, acting as a **protection mechanism** (similar to a put option).

# (Reflection – Payment for Order Flow, VPIN & Market Making)

## 1. PFOF and Order Flow

* **Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)** illustrates why **market makers prefer uninformed orders**:

  * Retail orders are generally **low toxicity**.
  * They allow stable spread capture with limited risk.
* **Informed orders** (institutions, insiders, fast algorithms) create **adverse selection**:

  * The market maker buys when it’s too expensive or sells too cheap.
  * This erodes P\&L.

---

## 2. Order Toxicity and VPIN

* **Order Toxicity** = the risk that orders originate from better-informed traders.
* **VPIN (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading):**

  * A statistical measure of the probability that the order flow is **informed and therefore toxic**.
  * Method: split trading activity into **volume bars** → measure buy/sell imbalance.
* Applications:

  * **Low VPIN** → retail flow, tight spreads, higher displayed depth.
  * **High VPIN** → informed flow, wider spreads, smaller displayed size, immediate hedging.

---

## 3. Spread Adjustment Based on Toxicity

* The bid-ask spread incorporates an **information risk premium**.
* Conceptual formula:

$$
\text{Optimal Spread} = \text{Minimal Spread (costs)} + f(\text{VPIN}, \sigma, \text{volatility})
$$

* **Low toxicity (low VPIN)** → tight spreads, aggressive quoting.
* **High toxicity (high VPIN)** → wider spreads, reduced liquidity provision.

---

## 4. Technology and Tools

* Market makers rely on models (VPIN, order imbalance) to detect toxicity and adjust quoting strategies.
* **Python**:

  * Sufficient for research, prototyping, backtesting, and developing full strategies (market making, arbitrage, options hedging).
  * EPAT + GitHub projects = strong foundation for a **quant trader / junior market maker** role.
* **C++**:

  * Required for **HFT production environments** (microsecond execution).
  * Used to optimize execution engines and low-latency strategies.
* In practice:

  * Python = **design & research**.
  * C++ = **live production**.
  * Top profiles master both, bridging prototypes into real-time systems.

---

Summary:

* **PFOF** = retail flow, low toxicity → highly attractive for market makers.
* **VPIN** = probability of informed flow (toxicity).
* **Spread** = dynamically adjusted according to VPIN and volatility.
* **Python** → perfect entry point for quant trading and strategy design.
* **C++** → essential mid-term step for pure HFT and latency optimization.

# [Government Debt]

## 1. Key Concepts

* **Public Finance**: government finance is not separate from markets; governments face lenders just like corporations.
* **Default**: failure to pay debt obligations (does not mean investors lose everything).
* **Repudiation**: outright refusal to ever pay the debt (e.g., Communist Russia and China).
* **Odious Debt**: debt declared illegitimate because it was contracted by a corrupt regime → morally justifiable to refuse repayment.

---

## 2. Why Invest in Risky Government Debt?

* Governments close to default **offer higher interest rates**.
* Debt is often **heavily discounted** (e.g., Venetian debt traded at 20% of par).
* Reasons why governments rarely repudiate:

  * It can only be done once → credibility loss.
  * They may need to borrow again in the future.
  * National reputation is at stake.

---

## 3. Historical and Contemporary Examples

* **Maoist China**: refusal to borrow aggravated famines.
* **Recent cases**:

  * **Puerto Rico**: high debt, U.S. dependency, justifications for default.
  * **Ukraine**: recurrent economic struggles.
  * **Greece**: sovereign crisis since 2010 → partial default in 2015 and ongoing restructuring.

---

## 4. Special Features of Sovereign Default

* Unlike corporations, **no international bankruptcy court** exists.
* Creditors must **negotiate directly with the state**.
* Process relies on:

  * **Reputation** (future access to capital markets).
  * **Collective negotiations** (haircuts, restructurings).
* **Holdout problem**: some creditors refuse deals.

  * Example: Argentina (2001) faced lawsuits and asset seizures abroad.
  * **Modern solution**: **Collective Action Clauses (CACs)** → majority decision binds all bondholders.

---

## 5. Historical Perspective

* Sovereign defaults are **common in history**.
* Since 1800 → repeated **waves of defaults** (often post-war or post-crisis).
* Very few years with zero defaults worldwide.
* According to **Reinhart & Rogoff**: defaults follow long-cycle patterns; another wave is likely after the financial crisis.

---

## 6. Takeaways

* Government debt is a **risky but high-yielding investment**.
* Default ≠ repudiation: partial restructurings are much more frequent.
* Reputation and future borrowing needs explain why governments still repay.
* **Collective Action Clauses** are designed to make restructurings smoother.
* Sovereign defaults tend to come in **historical waves**, and more are expected.

(reflection) 
The distinction between default and repudiation is fundamental.

Default is usually a partial failure to pay, followed by negotiations and restructurings.

Repudiation, on the other hand, is a radical and rare act: the government declares past debt illegitimate and refuses repayment entirely.

Two major historical cases illustrate this:

Russia (1917): After the Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet government repudiated Tsarist debt. Millions of French savers, who had invested heavily in “Russian bonds,” lost their savings. The USSR was cut off from international markets for decades.

China (1949): With the Communist victory, the People’s Republic of China refused to honor debts issued by the previous Nationalist government. Like Russia, this led to long-term financial isolation until reforms in the 1980s.

These episodes show that while repudiation may serve an ideological or revolutionary purpose, it carries severe reputational and economic consequences. Modern governments overwhelmingly avoid it, preferring restructuring over outright cancellation, in order to maintain access to international capital markets.

# [Government Involvement in Corporations]

## 1. Basic Principle

* Capitalism assumes a separation between **government** and **private corporations**.
* In reality, even in the United States (considered the most capitalist country), the government does intervene.

## 2. Forms of Involvement

1. **Regulation**: the government sets rules (safety, environment, etc.).
2. **Ownership**: the government can hold shares in companies.

   * In the U.S.: rare.
   * In China: common (large state ownership in major firms).
3. **Nationalization threat**: even in capitalist systems, there’s always an implicit risk of nationalization.

## 3. Case Study – TEPCO (Fukushima, Japan, 2011)

* Nuclear disaster → massive costs to the economy.
* Due to limited liability, TEPCO and its shareholders could not be fully charged with the damages.
* The Japanese government stepped in:

  * By July 2012, it owned 50% of TEPCO.
  * With debt converted into preferred shares → total control of **88.69%**.
* Consequences:

  * Private shareholders were heavily diluted.
  * The stock price collapsed.

## 4. Bankruptcy as State Involvement

* **Chapter 7** (U.S.): liquidation → company closed, assets sold, shareholders wiped out.
* **Chapter 11**: reorganization → company continues if it has enterprise value.

  * Example: **General Motors**.
  * Often involves the government taking on part of the losses.

## 5. Parallel with Personal Bankruptcy

* Bankruptcy law allows individuals and firms to **take risks**.
* If they fail, negative outcomes are partially **absorbed by the government**.
* Limitation: criminal behavior may lead to prison, but the financial losses are still socialized.

## 6. Conclusion

* Even when it tries to stay out, the **government becomes a de facto shareholder**.
* As David Moss put it: the government acts as **“Risk Manager of Last Resort.”**

---

(reflection)
Even in countries like the United States, which are considered very capitalist, there is always a hidden risk of nationalization. When a company becomes too important for the economy or for society, the government cannot simply let it fail. If the collapse of a bank threatens the entire financial system, or if a utility company creates damage that it cannot pay for, the state is forced to intervene.

This intervention can take many forms: bailouts, partial ownership, or full nationalization. In 2008, the U.S. government became the owner of companies such as AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to protect the financial system. In Japan, after the Fukushima disaster, the government took control of TEPCO because the damages were far too large for the company alone.

For investors, this means that their shares are never completely safe. Limited liability protects them personally, but when losses are too big, the government steps in and shareholders are diluted or wiped out. The state becomes the “risk manager of last resort.” That is why the threat of nationalization is always present, even if it is not visible in normal times

# [Municipal Finance]

## 1. States vs. Cities

* In the U.S., **state governments** are sovereign (similar to countries in the EU).
* The federal government **cannot** declare states bankrupt.
* But it **can** pass laws for municipal (city) bankruptcies → *Chapter 9 Bankruptcy*.

## 2. Why do cities borrow?

* One might think they should just raise taxes.
* But the problem is **population inflow and outflow**.
* Example: A new city needs roads, sewers, and schools.

  * If only the current small population pays, taxes would be unbearable.
  * Instead, the city **borrows now** and later taxes future residents to repay.
* It’s a reasonable **bet on growth**.

## 3. Balanced Budget Rules for States

* Almost all U.S. states prohibit **deficit spending** on their operating budgets.
* Example: Connecticut

  * Governor Lowell Weicker introduced an income tax.
  * Voters demanded a **balanced budget amendment** in return.
* Key distinction:

  * **Current account** = operating budget (salaries, annual expenses). → No deficits allowed.
  * **Capital account** = long-term investments (e.g., building schools). → Borrowing allowed.

## 4. Types of Local Debt

* **General Obligation Bonds** → repaid through future tax revenues.
* **Revenue Bonds** → linked to a specific project (e.g., toll road, bridge).

  * Repaid by project revenues (tolls, fees).
  * Similar to a **public entrepreneurial activity**.

## 5. Municipal Bankruptcy

* Special law exists for cities only: **Chapter 9**.
* Allows municipalities to restructure debt in times of crisis.

# [Government Social Insurance]

## 1. Historical Origins

* **Germany (Bismarck era, 1880s)**

  * 1883: Health insurance (*Krankenversicherung*).
  * 1884: Accident insurance (*Unfallversicherung*).
  * 1889: Disability & old-age insurance (*Invaliden- und Altersversicherung*).
    → Initiated by economists (Schmoller, Brentano, Wagner), not Bismarck himself.

* **United Kingdom (1911, Lloyd George)**

  * Introduction of unemployment insurance.
  * Inspired by German models (notably worker’s compensation).

## 2. Why Government Intervention?

* Private sector can manage some risks but not all.
* Public mistrust of private insurance schemes.
* Aim: **internalize social costs** and prevent visible misery (e.g., no cripples begging in German streets vs. London before worker’s comp).

## 3. Major U.S. Programs

* **Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC, 1935–1996)**

  * Abolished due to moral hazard concerns (permanent dependency).
  * Replaced by **SNAP** (renamed food stamps).

* **Progressive taxes**

  * Risk management device (negative taxes for low incomes via *Earned Income Tax Credit*).

* **Public education**

  * Massive transfer to low-income households through free schooling.

* **Social Security (OASDI, 1939)**

  * Covers old age, survivors, disability.
  * Renamed *Survivors Insurance* to avoid direct clash with private life insurance.

* **Worker’s Compensation**

  * Mandatory insurance paid by employers against workplace accidents.
  * Incentivizes safer workplaces and spreads worldwide.

* **Government health insurance**

  * Examples: Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare.

## 4. Tax Innovations

* **Civil War income tax** → failed (fraud, cash wages, poor documentation).
* **Withholding tax** → behavioral invention to ensure compliance (tax deducted at source).
* **Declining corruption** → stronger legal enforcement, cultural shift (e.g., no police bribes).

## 5. General Logic

* Public social insurance replaced **religious charity** (church-based insurance contracts).

* Core principles:

  * **Reduce individual risk**.
  * **Share risks collectively**.
  * **Incentivize safer and more productive behaviors**.

* Progress is slow but moves toward:

  * Protecting the most vulnerable.
  * Limiting moral hazard.
  * Building trust in economic systems.
