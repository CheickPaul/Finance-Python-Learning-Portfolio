# [Nonprofits]

## 1. Beyond Self-Interest

* Traditional economic theory: individuals are **purely selfish**, maximizing only their own consumption.
* Reality: people often seek **meaning** in life beyond material goods → this supports the nonprofit sector.

## 2. Characteristics of Nonprofits

* **No dividends, no shareholders** → they own themselves.
* **Non-distribution constraint**: profits must be **reinvested** or **given away**, not distributed.
* They exist to serve a **cause** rather than maximize profit.
* Example: Yale University is itself a **nonprofit**.

## 3. Economic Weight

* In 2013: **1.41 million nonprofits** in the U.S.
* About **10.2% of the U.S. workforce** employed in nonprofits (including volunteers).
* International average (13 advanced countries): **7.4% of workforce**.
* Higher share in developed countries (e.g., Israel 12.7%) vs. emerging (Brazil 3.7%).

## 4. Why People Contribute or Volunteer

* Retirees often prefer **volunteering** to inactivity.
* Motivations:

  * **Altruism** (helping society).
  * **Search for meaning / loyalty**.
  * **Religious values** (e.g., hospitals funded by churches, temples, mosques).

## 5. Civil Society

* Concept goes back to Aristotle (*koinonia politicae*) and Cicero (*societas civilis*).
* Represents citizens contributing to the **common good**.
* Example: **Darwin’s voyage** was funded not by government, but by a **philanthropist**.

## 6. Internal Management

* Though no dividends, many nonprofits (42%) use **bonus systems** for executives.
* Reason: they must **compete for talent** like for-profit firms.

## 7. Social Issues and Inequality

* Nonprofits help address inequality (e.g., access to healthcare).
* But some inequality can incentivize talented people to use their skills for **good causes**.

---

**Core Idea:** Nonprofits are a vital part of modern economies. They don’t distribute profits but instead reinvest them into their mission. They rely on complex human motivations (altruism, loyalty, religion, search for meaning) and embody **civil society**, funding projects that neither pure markets nor governments would support.

# [Cooperatives] 

## Definition

* A cooperative is a **for-profit business**, but different from a regular corporation.
* **Key rule**: *one person = one vote*, regardless of the number of shares owned.
* Profits are redistributed to members **in proportion to their purchases**, not to their shares.

## Historical Origins

* **1844, Rochdale (England)**: the *Rochdale Pioneers* founded the first cooperative (a grocery store).
* **Rochdale Principles**:

  * Voluntary and open membership.
  * Democratic member control.
  * Member economic participation.
  * Surpluses returned as rebates based on purchases.
* Different “spirit” compared to corporations: goal is to serve members, not exploit uninformed customers.

## Examples

* **Yale Cooperative Society (1885)**: created by Yale students, became the Yale Bookstore (no longer a cooperative today).
* Many cooperatives eventually fail because of management difficulties and competition.

## Difference with Corporations

* **Corporations**: goal = maximize profit for shareholders.
* **Cooperatives**: goal = maximize collective welfare of members.
* In practice:

  * Coops often sell healthier or community-oriented products.
  * Prices may be higher, product selection smaller.
  * They work best in strong communities with loyalty.
  * Advertising and growth are difficult, margins and wages can be lower.

## Economic Logic

* Members decide democratically on strategy.
* Focus is not on maximizing dividends, but on **improving group welfare**.
* Spirit is **social and community-based**, not purely profit-driven.

# [Alternative Forms Benefit Corporations] 

## Origin
- First created in **Maryland (2010)**.  
- Corporate law is state-based in the U.S., so each state must adopt it individually.  
- Rapidly spreading across many states.  

## Nature
- A **hybrid** between **for-profit** and **nonprofit**.  
- Dual mission:  
  - **Profit-making** (like a for-profit).  
  - **Social or environmental purpose** stated in the charter (like a nonprofit).  

## Example
- **Grower’s Secret** (fertilizer company).  
- Mission: restore the **NPK balance** (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) in ecosystems.  
- Their products reduce harmful fertilizer runoff that contaminates rivers and oceans.  

## Difference from Traditional Companies
- Normal companies may engage in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), but not as a legal obligation.  
- Benefit corporations have their **dual purpose embedded in their charter**.  

## Impact on Corporate Culture
- Creates a **different spirit**, closer to nonprofits.  
- Focus on doing the **right thing**, not only maximizing profit.  

## Current Stage
- Still relatively new (created in 2010).  
- Too early to judge long-term success, but growth is promising.  

## Broader Theme
- **Finance evolves through innovation.**  
- Just as worker’s compensation laws spread in the past, benefit corporations may represent a new wave.  
- Financial systems must consider **human psychology and social context**:  
  - Humans are not always rational.  
  - Finance should integrate values, community, and environmental needs.

# [Public vs. Private]  

## Overview
There are long-standing views about which activities are better handled by governments versus the private sector. Education is often government-run; industries like steel are typically private. Governments may be better at handling sensitive externalities and politically delicate human issues—yet no structure is immune to problems.

## Institutional Forms

### Government vs. Private
- **Government-run sectors:** favored where public externalities and welfare concerns dominate.  
- **Private sectors:** favored in competitive, industrial activities where profit incentives drive efficiency.

### The “In-Between”: Nonprofits
- Institutions like **Yale University** exemplify nonprofit organizations—neither state-run nor for-profit—reflecting diverse human motivations to contribute to society (philanthropy, mission, prestige).

## Incentives & Corruption Patterns

### State-Owned Enterprises
- Vulnerable to **political corruption** (e.g., officials diverting funds offshore as insurance against regime change).

### Private-Sector Firms (Public vs. Private Companies)
- **Public company:** listed on a stock exchange, open to general investors.  
- **Private company:** owned by a small set of shareholders, not listed.  
- Private firms can exhibit **marketing manipulation** and **fraud** when incentives and oversight are weak.

## Case Study — Patent Medicines & the Rise of Regulation

### Before ~1900
- “**Patent medicines**” were widely sold without proof of safety or efficacy.  
- Legal recourse existed only in clear, catastrophic cases (e.g., immediate harm), enabling fraudulent products to persist.

### After Regulation (~1900 onward)
- Drug regulation emerged across countries to **protect consumers**.  
- Today these protections are **broadly accepted** and seen as essential market infrastructure.

### Extreme Libertarian View (Rebutted)
- The view that firms **should not need to prove effectiveness** before marketing drugs implies experimenting on the public at scale.  
- Shiller rejects this, emphasizing **regulatory proof** as necessary to safeguard society.

## Key Takeaways
- **No single form** (government, for-profit, nonprofit) perfectly aligns with the public good in all contexts.  
- **Regulation** is a critical complement to markets where incentives can produce fraud (*phishing equilibrium*).  
- **Institutional diversity**—with clear rules and accountability—helps balance efficiency, innovation, and protection of the public.

# [Critics of Modern Finance]
Parfait, je vais enrichir ton résumé **Critics of Modern Finance** en y intégrant aussi **Rana Foroohar** (journaliste et auteure de *Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business*, 2016).

# [Critics of Modern Finance]

## Context
This lecture focuses on finding purpose in a world increasingly shaped by financial capitalism. Even those outside finance cannot escape its influence, since modern life is tied to financial systems.

## Key Critics

### Adair Turner
- Former professor at LSE, ex-head of the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA), now chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking.  
- Main concerns:  
  - **Debt explosion**: Domestic credit rose from ~40% of GDP in 1950 to ~160% today in advanced economies.  
  - **Finance’s share of GDP**: In the US, finance grew from ~1% of GDP in 1850 to ~7% today.  
- Questions whether this growth improves society or reflects **rent-seeking** (extracting value without creating it).  
- Developed these arguments in his book *Between Debt and the Devil* (2015), where he highlights the dangers of excessive private debt and proposes alternatives such as direct monetary financing.  

### Rana Foroohar
- Journalist and author of *Makers and Takers* (2016).  
- Main argument: Modern finance increasingly rewards **“takers”** (those focused on tax avoidance, financial engineering, and rent extraction) instead of **“makers”** (innovators and entrepreneurs).  
- Example:  
  - Under Steve Jobs, Apple prioritized creativity and innovation.  
  - After his death, Apple borrowed billions despite huge cash reserves, mainly to avoid repatriation taxes — a sign of financial engineering over innovation.  
- She links this trend to a **loss of creativity** in the business world, where financial motives often dominate over productive innovation.  

## Main Idea
- Critics are not rejecting finance itself, but **specific trends**:  
  - Excessive leverage and credit growth.  
  - The rise of finance’s share in GDP without proportional societal value.  
  - Corporate practices prioritizing tax optimization and rent-seeking over innovation and creativity.  

## Reflection
Both Turner and Foroohar highlight a central concern: **finance should serve the real economy, not dominate it**. The challenge is to redirect financial innovation and resources toward productive, socially beneficial activities instead of purely extractive ones.

# [Democratization of Finance]

## Definition
- Democratization of finance means making financial tools and opportunities accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy.  
- Finance should help manage risks for all people and reduce inequality.  

## Example: Crowdfunding
- Platforms like **Crowdcube (UK)** allow individuals with business ideas to raise money directly from the public.  
- Investors can interact in chat rooms, share opinions, and support creative ideas that traditional banks might reject.  
- Example project: **Home ultrasound kit** for pregnant women.  

## Regulatory Differences
- **UK** regulators: more open to experimentation.  
- **US** regulators: more cautious, fearing fraud and abuse.  
  - Limit of **$1 million per year** per company on crowdfunding.  
  - Individual investment caps:  
    - If income < $100,000 → max $2,000 or 5% of income.  
    - Aggregate limit: $100,000.  

## Benefits
- Access to **savings, pensions, insurance, and financing** has improved life for ordinary people.  
- Democratization fosters inclusion (e.g., women no longer needing a husband’s approval to manage money).  

## Challenges
- Risk of **fraud and manipulation**, similar to early telephone investment scams.  
- Regulation is highly **complex** (e.g., SEC crowdfunding rules run thousands of pages).  
- Progress often has **downsides**, requiring careful oversight and public consultation.  

## Key Takeaway
Finance acts as a **societal infrastructure**. Its democratization increases creativity, participation, and fairness, but also requires strong regulation to prevent abuse.
```
```
# [Salon- Democratization of Finance]

## Big Idea
Finance isn’t just about getting rich; it’s social infrastructure that helps civilization work better.  
A democratic financial system lets ordinary people feel “part of the action,” own ideas, and take informed risks.

## Why Participation Matters
- People take risk when they **own** the idea (identity and understanding drive risk-taking).
- Over the last 30 years, societies (e.g., Russia, China) have become more entrepreneurial and finance-literate; this pattern is spreading globally.

## Historical Precedent
- **19th-century UK savings bank movement**: nonprofit/mutual savings banks built for small savers.
- Design choices (conservative portfolios; pro-saver charters) meant **no savings bank failures in the U.S. during the Great Depression**.
- Lesson: democratization isn’t new; durable progress comes from **institutional design** that protects small participants.

## Modern Enablers
- **Commission-free platforms** and **small-ticket/fractional investing** reduce barriers to entry.
- Goal: ensure these tools **benefit low-income households**, not just privileged users.

## Literacy vs. Advice
- Analogy to medicine:
  - You need **basic literacy** (when to seek help; healthy habits).
  - You also need a **trusted generalist advisor** (the “financial GP”) for diagnosis, planning, and behavioral issues.
- Today we over-index on “financial literacy” curricula and under-invest in **accessible, trustworthy advice**—including the psychological dimension (e.g., problem gambling, risky speculation).

## Nudges and “Libertarian Paternalism”
- Concept (Thaler & Sunstein): preserve **freedom to choose** while structuring **defaults** so that inaction leads to a reasonable outcome.
- Examples:
  - **Automatic enrollment** into retirement/health plans with opt-out instead of opt-in.
- Rationale:
  - People procrastinate; intelligence varies; systems must **work well for everyone** by default.

## Design Principles for Democratized Finance
1. **Default Good Outcomes**: Auto-enrollment, target-date funds, fee caps, simple menus.  
2. **Small-Saver Protection**: Conservative product design; clear disclosures; conflict-free distribution.  
3. **Trusted Advice at Scale**: Low-cost advisory models (hybrid human + digital), community-based guidance.  
4. **Behavior-Aware Programs**: Group support, commitment devices, and guardrails to counter harmful habits.  
5. **Inclusive Access**: Low minimums, commission-free execution, fair order handling, and financial education linked to action.

## Key Takeaways
- Democratization is a **design problem**: institutions, defaults, and advice matter as much as access.  
- Aim for systems where **doing nothing** often yields **something reasonable**, and **doing more** (with guidance) can yield better outcomes.  
- The objective is not just participation—it’s **safe, dignified, upward-mobility participation** for low- and middle-income households.

# [Finance and War]

War has always been a recurrent feature of human history, with deep implications for finance. Since finance deals largely with long-term claims, wars and regime changes can disrupt institutions and raise questions about the survival of contracts and property rights.

## Key Historical Examples

### World War I – Reparations
- Germany was defeated in 1918 and reparations were imposed.
- Instead of confiscating private property or shares, reparations were demanded from the government, to be financed through taxes.
- Ultimately, reparations were cancelled in the 1920s due to political backlash, meaning private shareholders in German companies kept their assets.

### World War II – Lessons Learned
- Victors avoided penalizing individuals for their government’s actions.
- In West Germany, private holdings were preserved.
- In East Germany, under communist ideology, private property was confiscated. Some restitution occurred only after reunification.

### Iran (1979 Revolution)
- The Shah was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution.
- Despite regime hostility to the old order, pensions earned under the Shah were respected by the new regime.

### South Africa (1994 Transition)
- End of apartheid and transfer of power to a black majority government.
- Pensions and insurance contracts were left intact, signaling a desire for stability.

### Confiscation Under Socialist Ideologies
- Leaders such as Lenin, Mao, Cárdenas, Mossadegh, Nasser, and Indira Gandhi used socialist theories to justify expropriation of assets and cancellation of contracts.

### Japan after World War II
- The US forced Zaibatsu conglomerates (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Yasuda) to sell assets and hold proceeds in nominal yen government bonds.
- Massive postwar inflation wiped out the value of those bonds, effectively destroying their wealth.

## General Insights

- **Civil Society Considerations**: Often, even hostile regimes maintain financial claims (pensions, contracts) to preserve social trust and stability.
- **Exceptions**: Socialist or revolutionary ideologies sometimes justify confiscation.
- **Odious Debt**: Debt incurred by governments for illegitimate or abusive purposes is more likely to be repudiated after regime change.
- **Ethical Basis of Finance**: The survival of financial claims depends not only on legal enforcement but also on civil society’s perception of fairness and legitimacy.

## Takeaway
War creates uncertainty for finance, but history shows that individual property rights are often preserved—except when ideologies justify expropriation. For long-term investors, it is crucial to evaluate not only financial metrics but also the moral and political context of issuers, since civil society ultimately decides the legitimacy of financial contracts.

# [Finance and Population Growth]

## Big Idea  
Thomas Malthus (1798) introduced the *“Dismal Law of Economics”*:  
- **Population grows geometrically** (doubling every ~25 years).  
- **Food/resources grow arithmetically** (much slower).  
- Result: subsistence improvements get offset by more people, leading to recurrent scarcity.  

## Malthusian Trap  
- Historical pattern: societies hover near **starvation levels**.  
- Efforts to improve living standards only fuel more population growth.  
- Core message: **hopelessness** about solving poverty in the long run.  

## Critique and Modern View  
- Malthus’ argument is logically powerful but pessimistic.  
- Likely valid in the *very long run* (centuries), but misleading for the present.  
- Human creativity, technology, and finance have historically expanded resource use beyond Malthus’ arithmetic constraint.  

## Role of Finance  
- Finance can **allocate resources efficiently** and **smooth consumption** despite population pressures.  
- It provides tools to invest in innovation, infrastructure, and health—directly countering the Malthusian cycle.  

## Ethical Imperative  
- Even if the future centuries are uncertain, we have a **moral duty** today:  
  - Use economic and financial principles to improve **current welfare**.  
  - Focus on making the world **better off now**, rather than surrendering to long-term fatalism.  

## Key Takeaways  
- Malthus: population growth outpaces resources → inevitable scarcity.  
- Reality: innovation and finance can **delay or overcome** these limits in practice.  
- Finance’s moral role: ensure that gains today translate into **better lives now**, not despair about distant centuries.


(reflection)

I don’t think population growth is a threat to economic stability. Humanity will always find a way to adapt. Technology can allow us to optimize consumption, and we should take advantage of that.  

For me, trading is a way to benefit from the financial flows circulating around the world. The real challenge lies in how trading firms use the revenues they generate, especially through the investments they make.  

In my view, I earn in the short term to finance projects and support the economy in the long term. I see trading as a way to generate quick gains in order to contribute to economic development (investment in startups, in capital, etc.).  

I want my career to be lucrative, but also to give back: by training younger generations, by investing in education, and by supporting local community projects.  
```

```
# [The Importance of Financial Theory]

Finance is not just about speculation or short-term gains. The development of **mathematical finance** in the 20th century fundamentally changed the way scarce resources are allocated and how information is pooled through markets. While behavioral finance adds a valuable dimension, the core mathematical framework remains essential.

## Core Contributions of Mathematical Finance
- **Resource Allocation**: Provides a rigorous framework for distributing scarce resources efficiently through financial markets.  
- **Information Pooling**: Markets aggregate diverse information, allowing for better decision-making and pricing of risk.  
- **Systemic Benefits**: Even seemingly “unproductive” activities (e.g., options trading) contribute to market efficiency and stability.  

## Behavioral Finance as Friction
- Behavioral finance complements mathematical finance by incorporating psychology and social sciences.  
- Like adding friction to Newton’s mechanics, it brings models closer to real-world human behavior.  
- Rather than threatening traditional finance, it enriches it and helps explain anomalies.  

## Interdisciplinary Integration
- **Law and Economics**: Law schools bring real-world and psychological perspectives, grounding abstract economic principles in lived disputes and legal cases.  
- **Breaking Silos**: Finance, law, and management should not remain compartmentalized. Collaboration across these disciplines strengthens both theory and practice.  

## General Insights
- Mathematical finance is the backbone of modern markets, while behavioral finance ensures realism.  
- The financial system, though imperfect, enables large-scale social benefits such as feeding billions, education, and innovation.  
- Long-term legitimacy of finance depends on integrating multiple perspectives, including law and psychology.  

## Takeaway
Traditional financial theory remains valid and powerful, but it must evolve. By adding behavioral insights and collaborating with fields like law, finance can operate more effectively in the real world—balancing efficiency with human psychology and social trust.  
```
(reflection)
**Mathematical vs Behavioral Finance**  
Mathematical models allow us to get closer to understanding markets, but we can never be 100% right.  
Coming from a background in discretionary trading, which is heavily rooted in behavioral finance, I am now learning quantitative tools to become more precise and performant.  
Quantitative methods, especially advanced statistics, enable the analysis of thousands of past scenarios and the generation of dynamic strategies that adapt to market conditions.  

**Ethics and Legitimacy**  
For me, legitimacy comes from a mix of three elements: mathematical models, law, and social trust.  
- Mathematical models improve efficiency and performance.  
- Law brings regulation and justice to the market.  
- Social trust ensures longterm stability and acceptance of financial systems.

# [Wealth and Poverty]

## Rising Inequality
- Growing public concern about inequality is shaping politics, both left and right.  
- Studies (e.g., David Autor at MIT) show strong links between job losses (due to globalization/automation) and political polarization.  
- Inequality is not just economic—it drives political and social divides.  

## Risk and Poverty
- Communities built around factories are highly vulnerable: when factories close, jobs and property values collapse.  
- Example: workers buy homes near factories, but when production moves abroad, both jobs and home values vanish.  
- Poor families often lack access to financial advice that could have warned them (“rent, don’t buy”).  
- Current tax incentives for financial advisers favor the wealthy; low-income families receive no real benefit.  
- Poverty often stems from unmanaged risks → democratizing finance means extending risk management tools to everyone.  

## Behavioral Biases
- Kahneman & Tversky’s “What You See Is All There Is”: people over-rely on local, visible information.  
- Common misconceptions: “housing prices always rise,” “buying is always better than renting.”  
- Without advisers, people make naïve, risky financial decisions.  

## Wealth and Monuments
- Wealth often gets redistributed after death through institutions, monuments, or philanthropy.  
- Example:  
  - Mr. Zhang (Chinese Yale alumnus) funded an auditorium while still young.  
  - J.P. Morgan built a mansion in Manhattan (1906–1910), lived there only 3 years; today it is a museum.  
- Wealth accumulation fuels cultural and societal legacies, though often unevenly distributed.  

## The Trade-off
- Societies that encourage dealmaking and wealth accumulation generate more wealth—but also more inequality.  
- Even primitive societies showed this trade-off.  
- In advanced economies, inequality is less about survival and more about distribution of opportunities and comfort.  
```
(reflection)
```markdown
## Personal Reflection

- The democratization of finance can truly help reduce inequalities, but only if individuals are willing to learn and accept discipline. Often, poverty results from a lack of discipline: living beyond one’s means, seeking short-term pleasures at the expense of long term investment.  

- The role of government in this area is limited. It will not directly subsidize financial advice for low-income households. Instead, families, communities, and financial education associations should take responsibility for passing on this knowledge—especially to younger generations—by encouraging reading and participation in educational programs.  

```
``
# [Your Career and Finance]

## Wealth, Morality, and Timing
- Early gifts have limited impact if income is low.  
- Strategy: accumulate skills and capital when young, give back meaningfully later.  
- Examples: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge; Carnegie’s “Gospel of Wealth.”  

## Creative Finance for Society
- Muhammad Yunus (Grameen Bank, Nobel Peace Prize 2006): microloans to empower poor entrepreneurs.  
- Lesson: democratizing finance can be profitable and socially impactful.  

## Future of Financial Capitalism
- Financial markets will be pervasive.  
- Booms and crashes will likely be larger despite regulation (FSB, Dodd-Frank).  
- Information technology will reshape products, risks, and opportunities.  

## Randomness, Risk, and Perspective
- Think on a century scale (you, your children, society).  
- Beware the “what you see is all there is” bias.  
- Chance plays a major role in outcomes (Ecclesiastes IX; Taleb’s *Fooled by Randomness*).  
- Finance manages risk but cannot eliminate it.  

## Career Actions
- Invest in human capital: build adaptable, durable skills.  
- Study risk management and financial theory; pair with real-world practice.  
- Position yourself relative to historical shifts, not just your personal timeline.  
- Maintain humanity and ethics in an unforgiving business environment.  
```
(reflection)

## Wealth & Morality
I believe one should accumulate, save, and give back a portion to associations of their choice. During one’s career, it is important to build a portfolio and practice DCA. At the birth of children, also start a DCA with a money manager for them.  

## Creative Finance
Be active in youth associations and encourage them early on to invest in risk-free assets and to save.  

## Future of Finance
Today, in my view, it is essential to train seriously in AI tools: Machine Learning, Quant, etc.


### English (King James Version)
I returned, and saw under the sun,  
that the race is not to the swift,  
nor the battle to the strong,  
neither yet bread to the wise,  
nor yet riches to men of understanding,  
nor yet favour to men of skill;  
but time and chance happeneth to them all.
