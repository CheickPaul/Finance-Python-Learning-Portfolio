## Overview

This repository centralizes structured notes from the *Financial Markets* course.

The objective is to consolidate key concepts in risk management, asset pricing, behavioral finance, and financial institutions, and to maintain a long-term reference framework for academic and professional development.

Notes were originally taken progressively throughout the course and have been reorganized here for clarity and continuity.
