[Salon - Recessions]

### 1. Nature of Recessions

* According to Robert Shiller (*Animal Spirits*, with George Akerlof), recessions are **largely psychological**.
* Similar to depression: even with intervention from a central bank or government, recovery is not immediate.

### 2. Inverted Yield Curves

* Occur when **short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates**.
* Normally, long-term rates are higher due to greater risk.
* Historically, an inverted yield curve has been a **leading indicator of recessions**.
* Explanations include:

  * **Long-term pessimism**: investors expect weak growth and low investment (examples: Japan, Germany).
  * **Central bank tightening**: in the past, central banks raised short-term rates sharply to fight inflation, often triggering recessions.

### 3. Other Indicators

* **Stock market**: the most widely recognized leading indicator.

  * Examples: 1929, 2000, 2007 → significant declines preceded recessions.
  * Acts as a **self-fulfilling prophecy**: falling markets increase fear, reduce spending and investment, and deepen downturns.
* **Bond market spreads** (e.g., LIBOR–OIS) can show stress but are generally less predictive than equities.

### 4. Forecasting Challenges

* Recessions are **difficult to forecast** until clear signs such as rising unemployment appear.
* Similar to predicting whether a movie will succeed: public sentiment and collective psychology drive outcomes.
* Conclusion: indicators can sometimes give signals, but **never with full reliability**.


[History of Mortgage Lending]

Mortgage lending is one of the oldest forms of credit. Its history highlights how collateral, property law, and financial institutions evolved to support real estate markets.

## Origins

* The word **mortgage** comes from the Latin *mort* (death), meaning *dead pledge*.
* Collateral has existed for centuries: if the borrower fails to repay, the lender can sell the pledged property.

## Modern Concept

* To **mortgage a house** means to pledge it as collateral in exchange for a loan.
* If the borrower defaults, the bank repossesses and sells the property.
* The loan depends more on the **value of the property** than on the trustworthiness of the borrower.

## Historical Development

* **Tang Dynasty (China):** Relatives could be fined if the borrower defaulted.
* **18th Century (Europe):** Property ownership was unclear. People posted newspaper ads to claim rights, often leading to disputes.
* **Late 19th Century (Germany):** Introduction of the **Grundbuch**, a centralized registry of property ownership, which improved legal clarity and reduced fraud.

## Key Takeaways

* Mortgage lending enabled large-scale real estate financing.
* Clear and reliable property registration is essential for stable credit markets.
* Systems like the **Grundbuch** shaped the foundation of today’s modern property laws.


[Commercial Real Estate Vehicles]
Perfect — here’s the same README **in English** for your GitHub:

---

# Commercial Real Estate Vehicles – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. Real Estate Partnerships (DPP – Direct Participation Programs)

* Available only to **accredited investors** (SEC criteria):

  * Net worth > \$1M (excluding primary residence)
  * or annual income > \$200k
* Structured as a **limited partnership**:

  * **General Partner**: manages the business, has unlimited liability, must hold at least 1%.
  * **Limited Partners**: passive investors, limited liability.
* **Tax advantage**: profits flow through to investors (no corporate tax).
* Limitation: must have a **finite life** (not perpetual).
* Example: purchase an apartment building, operate for 20 years, then sell and liquidate.

## 2. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

* Created in **1960 by U.S. Congress** to give small investors access to real estate.
* Benefit from **pass-through taxation** (no corporate profits tax) but must follow strict rules:

  * 75% of assets in real estate or cash.
  * 75% of income from real estate.
  * 90% of income distributed to shareholders.
  * Max 30% of income from sales of properties held < 4 years.
* Have grown significantly, adopted worldwide.
* Can specialize by type: e.g., **golf course REITs**, retail REITs, etc.

## 3. Historical REIT Cycles

* **1960s**: Initial boom, followed by real estate downturn.
* **1986**: Tax reform reduced partnership advantages → REITs gained traction.
* **1992**: Third boom, rise of specialized REITs.

## 4. Housing Prices – Key Drivers

* **Classical view**: driven by construction costs.
* **Modern reality**: heavily influenced by **psychology and speculation** → bubbles.
* Structural factors: scarcity of space (e.g., Manhattan, Los Angeles), glamour appeal.
* Political/economic factors: **free market revolution** (Thatcher, Reagan, Deng Xiaoping) → widespread fear of housing scarcity and rising unaffordability.

[Mortgages, part 1]

# Mortgages, Part 1 – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. Overview of the U.S. Mortgage Market

* Total mortgage debt held by households: **\$13.2 trillion** (recent figure).
* About **48 million mortgaged homes** in the U.S. (\~1 per 6–7 people).
* After the **2008 financial crisis**, nearly **11 million homes (1 in 5)** were “underwater” (home value < mortgage).

### Jingle Mail

* Homeowners in negative equity could abandon homes by mailing back the keys (“jingle mail”).
* Works mainly in **non-recourse states** (lender cannot pursue assets beyond the house).
* In recourse states, lenders *can* pursue further claims but often don’t (too costly).

---

## 2. Impact of Negative Equity on the Economy

* Many households, especially young families, hold most of their wealth in their house.
* When underwater → **negative net worth** → families stopped spending.
* Led to sharp contraction in consumer spending → worsened recession.

---

## 3. Evolution of Mortgage Structures

* **Pre-1930s**: mortgages were short-term (2–5 years).

  * Homeowners relied on refinancing at maturity.
  * During the **Great Depression**: unemployment + housing crash → banks refused renewals → mass foreclosures.
* **1934**: Roosevelt administration created the **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**.

  * FHA **insured banks** against borrower default.
  * Introduced **long-term mortgages** (15 years minimum, later 30 years became standard).
  * Objective: stabilize the housing market and restore lending.

---

## 4. FHA and Long-Term Trends

* FHA still active but has faced solvency issues after waves of defaults.
* Insurance premiums increased (from 0.5% → 1.5% annually).
* 30-year mortgages became the **norm in the U.S.**, especially for younger buyers.

---

## 5. Overvaluation vs. Undervaluation of Housing

* Public focus often on **housing bubbles** (overvaluation).
* But **undervaluation** is also an issue:

  * Examples: Detroit, parts of Baltimore.
  * Homes priced **below construction cost** → no incentive for new building.
  * Potential for **value investing** if the city recovers (jobs, redevelopment).
* Key idea: prices capped by **construction costs** on the upside, and supported by them on the downside.

[Mortgages, part 2]

## 1. Mortgage Rates and Treasury Yields

* **30-year mortgage rates** closely track the **10-year U.S. Treasury yield**.
* Reason: although mortgages are issued for 30 years, **average life ≈ 10 years** (due to moving, refinancing, selling).
* Hence, mortgage pricing aligns with 10-year yields.
* A **spread** exists between mortgages and Treasuries due to:

  * Credit risk (default risk).
  * Servicing costs (collections, paperwork, insurance).
  * Mortgage insurance (e.g., FHA, \~0.5–1.5%).

---

## 2. Historical Peaks – 1980s Inflation

* 1982: Mortgage rates peaked at **\~19%**.
* Example: a \$300k house → annual mortgage payments \~20% = \$60k/year.
* Result: affordability crisis → **home prices collapsed**.
* Inflation adjusted some of the burden, but cash payments were unsustainable.

---

## 3. Alternative Mortgage Designs

* **PLAM (Price Level Adjusted Mortgage):**

  * Payments adjusted for inflation.
  * Sometimes with *negative amortization* (initial payments below interest, principal rises).
  * Designed for high inflation eras. Rare today.

* **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):**

  * Rate tied to short-term benchmarks (e.g., 1-year Treasury + spread).
  * Payments fluctuate with market interest rates.

* **Shared Appreciation Mortgages (SAMs):**

  * Borrower pays lender a share of the property’s appreciation instead of (or in addition to) interest.
  * Popular in the UK in the 1990s–2000s but fell out of favor when housing boomed.

* **Home Equity Loans / Second Mortgages:**

  * Borrowing against home value for consumption (renovations, vacations).
  * Expanded pre-2008 → households became overleveraged.

---

## 4. Inflation and Housing Markets

* Late 1970s–early 1980s: **double-digit inflation** (12%+).
* Fed (under **Paul Volcker**) raised interest rates aggressively.
* Result: mortgage rates >18%, housing prices dropped to extreme lows.
* Without inflation-adjusted mortgages (like PLAMs), affordability collapsed.
* Prices later recovered once inflation and interest rates declined.

---

[PMI, CMOs, CDOs] 

# PMI, CMOs, and CDOs – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)

* Introduced alongside **FHA insurance (1934)** and **VA insurance (post-WWII)**.
* **Purpose**: protects lenders if borrower defaults.
* **Who pays?** The *borrower (homeowner)* pays PMI if down payment < 20% of home value.

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Rule

* **Definition**:

  $$
  \text{LTV} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Property Value}} \times 100
  $$
* **When required**: PMI applies if **LTV > 80%** (borrower’s equity < 20%).
* **Cancellation**:

  * Borrower may **request cancellation** once LTV ≤ 80% (with good payment history and possibly a new appraisal).
  * PMI must be **automatically terminated** at **78% LTV** (per the original amortization schedule, assuming payments are current).
  * Final termination rule: PMI must end by the **midpoint of the loan term** if not canceled earlier.

### Issues

* Lenders rarely notify borrowers when PMI is no longer required (≤ 80% LTV).
* Many homeowners **overpay for years** unless they proactively request cancellation.
* Some PMI companies collapsed during the financial crisis (e.g., PMI Group Inc.).

---

## 2. CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations)

* **Process**:

  * Banks originate mortgages → sell them to investors as securities.
  * Mortgages pooled together → structured into **tranches** (slices).
* **Tranches**:

  * **Senior tranche (AAA)**: gets paid first, least risky.
  * **Mezzanine tranches (AA, A, BBB, etc.)**: higher risk, higher yield.
  * **Equity tranche ("toxic waste")**: absorbs first losses, very risky. Sometimes bought by hedge funds at deep discounts.
* **Benefit**: Allows creation of **AAA-rated securities** from risky mortgage pools.

---

## 3. CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)

* Similar to CMOs but broader:

  * Can include not just mortgages, but also **auto loans, credit card debt, corporate loans**, etc.
  * Also structured into tranches with varying levels of risk.
* Both **CMOs and CDOs** became central to the **2007–2009 financial crisis**:

  * Defaults reached into supposedly “safe” senior tranches.
  * Rating agencies had overrated securities (AAA ratings proved unreliable).

---

## 4. Crisis Lessons

* During the financial crisis, **AAA tranches lost value**, but often not as catastrophically as markets feared.
* In 2009, beaten-down CMOs and CDOs were **undervalued opportunities** for smart investors.
* Key insight: markets are **not fully efficient**, especially in crises.
* **Smart money** (with institutional knowledge) bought distressed assets when panic selling pushed prices too low.

---

[Post Crisis Regulation ]


# Post-Crisis Regulation – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. Background

* After the **2007–2009 financial crisis**, public anger grew over:

  * **Mortgage originators** approving risky loans (“liar’s loans”) knowing they would resell them.
  * **CMOs/CDOs** repackaging poor-quality mortgages and marketing them as safe investments.
* Problem: Banks had **no incentive to check quality**, since they did not retain the risk.

---

## 2. European Response

* **Rule:** Mortgage originators must retain **at least 5%** of the loans they issue.
* Purpose: Align incentives → discourage reckless lending (e.g., liar’s loans).

---

## 3. U.S. Response – Dodd-Frank Act (2010)

* Copied the **5% risk retention rule**, *except* for **Qualified Residential Mortgages (QRM)**.
* **QRM = “safe” mortgages** that meet strict underwriting standards.
* Dodd-Frank left regulators to define what counts as QRM.

  * Took 4 years, with thousands of industry comments and lobbying.
  * Final rule ran **689 pages**.

---

## 4. QRM Standards (simplified)

To be considered a QRM (and exempt from 5% retention), a mortgage must:

* Have **equal or substantially equal payments** (no teaser rates leading to payment shocks).
* **No negative amortization** (loan balance can’t grow).
* **No balloon payments** at the end (must be annuity-style).
* **Max term = 30 years**.
* **Points and fees ≤ 3%** of loan amount.
* For adjustable-rate mortgages: use the **max interest rate in the first 5 years** when testing affordability.
* **Borrower’s income and assets must be verified** (no more “stated income” loans).
* **Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio ≤ 43%**.
* ⚠️ Notably: No explicit **Loan-to-Value (LTV) cap** in the U.S. (other countries often set max LTV, e.g., 90%).

---

## 5. Implications

* Post-crisis, mortgages in the U.S. are far more regulated.
* A standard QRM mortgage today looks like:

  * **30-year fixed**
  * Fully documented income/assets
  * **DTI < 43%**
  * No exotic features (negative amortization, balloon payments).

---

[Chalk Talks - Excess Reserves ]
# Excess Reserves & Banking Frictions

## 1. Context: Reserve Requirements

* Historically, banking crises often came from **bank runs**: depositors rushed to withdraw funds at the same time.
* To prevent this, regulators imposed **reserve requirements**: banks must keep a minimum level of liquid assets.
* These reserves come from **customer deposits**: a portion of deposits is immobilized and kept either in cash or at the central bank.
* They do not come directly from the bank’s profits, but represent a fraction of deposits that the bank cannot use for lending or investment.

---

## 2. Definition: Excess Reserves

* **Excess reserves = reserves held above the regulatory minimum.**
* Historically, banks held very little, since reserves **earned no interest**.
* Banks preferred to lend these funds instead of keeping them idle.

---

## 3. Why Did Banks Hold More After 2008?

* During the **Great Recession**, central banks cut interest rates down to **zero**.
* Lending opportunities became unattractive, so banks left more money in reserves.
* Post-crisis regulations also discouraged risky lending.

---

## 4. Consequence: Idle Money and Secular Stagnation

* Massive amounts of liquidity remained unused, **earning nothing**.
* This reflects a **structural weakness in the global economy**: lack of safe and profitable investment opportunities.
* Economists call this **secular stagnation**.

---

## 5. Information Problems: Moral Hazard & Adverse Selection

* **Moral Hazard**:
  Example: fire insurance → a policyholder might deliberately burn their house to collect compensation.
  *Solution*: never insure the full value, to maintain aligned incentives.

* **Adverse Selection**:
  High-yield loans attract riskier borrowers (e.g., junk bonds).
  For a cautious bank, these are not opportunities but **traps**.

---

## 6. How Banks Manage These Frictions

* Banking is about **investing in information and trust-based relationships**.
* Tools include:

  * local offices and networks,
  * personal knowledge of clients,
  * observation and intuition.
* A well-run bank combines **data analysis** and **human judgment** to decide whether to lend.

---

## Summary

After the 2008 crisis, banks accumulated large excess reserves due to a lack of profitable and safe lending opportunities. This reflects a structural problem of **weak investment demand** and underlines the importance of managing **moral hazard** and **adverse selection** through information and trusted relationships.

[The Bubble, part 1 ]
# The Bubble, Part 1 – Early Signs of Irrational Exuberance

## 1. Context: Speculative Price Movements

* Bubbles are characterized by **rapid price increases** disconnected from fundamentals.  
* In housing, as in stocks, people begin to believe that **past increases will continue indefinitely**.  
* Robert Shiller highlights that investors often ignore historical evidence and instead rely on **short-term memory**.  

---

## 2. The Psychology of Bubbles

* Bubbles are driven by **social contagion**: people copy the behavior of others.  
* Narratives spread quickly:  
  - “Housing is the safest investment.”  
  - “Prices never fall nationwide.”  
* This is reinforced by **media coverage**, which tends to celebrate rising prices and success stories.  

---

## 3. Historical Patterns

* In U.S. history, there were several housing booms before the 2000s.  
* These past episodes show the same pattern:  
  - Prices increase sharply.  
  - Optimism spreads.  
  - Eventually, corrections occur, often severely.  
* Yet, people in each new cycle tend to **ignore previous crashes**.  

---

## 4. Misperceptions of Risk

* Investors underestimate the possibility of **price declines**.  
* When prices rise for years, people conclude that risk is minimal.  
* This leads to **over-leverage**, excessive borrowing, and unsustainable speculation.  

---

## 5. Early Warnings Before the 2000s Bubble

* By the late 1990s and early 2000s, housing prices had already shown unusual growth compared to historical norms.  
* Long-term ratios such as **price-to-income** and **price-to-rent** were diverging from their averages.  
* Few analysts or institutions highlighted these risks, reinforcing the bubble’s build-up.  

---

## 6. The Role of Data and Information

* The absence of widely available **long-term housing price series** contributed to the bubble.  
* Most people only saw short-term trends (5–10 years).  
* Without a broader historical perspective, they assumed growth was structural and permanent.  

---

## 7. Protecting Against Bubble Misperceptions

1. **Historical Context**  
   - Always compare current valuations with long-term averages.  
   - Use at least 50–100 years of data where available.  

2. **Skepticism Toward Narratives**  
   - Question “new era” stories claiming that fundamentals no longer matter.  
   - Avoid herd mentality and excessive reliance on media-driven optimism.  

3. **Risk Management**  
   - Limit leverage during rapid price expansions.  
   - Diversify across assets to reduce exposure to a single overheated market.  

---

## Summary

The first signs of the 2000s U.S. housing bubble showed how **psychology, narratives, and short-term thinking** can distort perceptions of risk.  
Despite clear historical evidence of past housing cycles, investors convinced themselves that **“this time is different.”**  

For investors, the lessons are:  
- Always place market movements in a **long historical context**.  
- Be cautious of **contagious optimism and media narratives**.  
- Maintain prudent leverage and diversification during speculative booms.  


[The Bubble, part 2 ]

## 1. Context: U.S. Housing Boom and Bust

* Home prices peaked in **2006**, then collapsed dramatically.  
* Surveys of new homebuyers show a clear pattern:  
  - When prices rise → buyers strongly believe real estate is the best long-term investment.  
  - When prices fall → this belief weakens.  
* This is a form of **wishful thinking bias**: people justify their purchase with optimism.  

## 2. The Problem of Short Data Horizons

* Most investors only see **short-term price series** (5–10 years).  
* Newspapers and media rarely publish **century-long series**, so people extrapolate recent trends.  
* Result: many assume **“prices always go up”**, ignoring historical cycles.  

---

## 3. Housing Starts as a Macro Driver

* **Housing starts** = new residential constructions (houses, apartments, improvements).  
* Highly **volatile** and strongly linked to home prices:  
  - When prices are high → builders increase construction (profit margins are large).  
  - When prices fall → construction collapses.  
* Example: After 2006, housing starts fell by **80%** before recovering.  

---

## 4. Historical Episodes

* **1970s**: Housing boom with strong price increases.  
* **1990s–2006**: Largest boom in U.S. history.  
  - Prices rose sharply.  
  - Construction reached near-record highs.  
  - Collapse led to dramatic declines in both prices and starts.  

---

## 5. The Role of Animal Spirits

* **Animal spirits** = collective optimism that reinforces bubbles.  
* Belief that housing “always” appreciates drives speculation and overbuilding.  
* These collective beliefs are **unstable** and eventually reverse.  

---

## 6. The Challenge of Bubble Prediction

* **Timing** is very difficult:  
  - Nobody knows exactly when a bubble will burst.  
  - Collective psychology can keep prices irrationally high for years.  
* Still, ignoring the possibility of reversal is a major mistake:  
  - History shows **millions of people can be wrong at the same time**.  
  - Bubbles repeat across generations.  

---

## 7. Protecting Against Housing Bubbles

1. **Long-Term Data Awareness**  
   - Use long historical price series (over 50–100 years).  
   - Compare current valuations to historical averages (price-to-income, price-to-rent).  

2. **Macro Monitoring**  
   - Track housing starts, construction employment, mortgage lending growth.  
   - Extreme construction booms are warning signs.  

3. **Diversification**  
   - Avoid concentrated exposure to overheated housing markets.  
   - Mix regions, property types, and even asset classes.  

4. **Cycle Discipline**  
   - Reduce leverage when valuations are stretched.  
   - Maintain liquidity to seize opportunities after corrections.  

---

## Summary

The U.S. housing boom of the 1990s–2006 illustrates how **optimism, short-sighted data, and animal spirits** fuel bubbles. Housing starts amplify the cycle, as builders respond to temporary profit margins. When the bubble bursts, the economic impact is severe.  

For investors, the key lessons are:  
- **Do not extrapolate recent growth into the future.**  
- **Use long-term data to anchor expectations.**  
- **Track housing activity as a macro signal.**  
- **Maintain diversification and cycle awareness to withstand downturns.**

  [The Bubble, part 3

# The Bubble, Part 3

## 1. Overvaluation Perceptions in 2004

* Shiller’s surveys showed that U.S. households expected **+12% annual home price growth** for the next 10 years.
* At this pace, prices would **double in \~6 years**, even though they were already at record levels.
* With 30-year mortgage rates around **6%**, the gap between **borrowing costs** and **expected appreciation** looked highly attractive.

## 2. Leverage and Tax Advantages

* Down payments were often as low as **5% or less**, implying **\~20:1 leverage**.
* A positive spread of 6 points (12% – 6%).
* Mortgage interest was **tax deductible**, while appreciation was taxed as capital gains (often deferred or exempt).
* This created an impression of very high returns → strong incentives to buy.

## 3. Absence of the Word “Bubble”

* Until 2005, the term *housing bubble* was rarely used.
* Finance courses taught that markets were **efficient**:

  * an efficient market instantly and fully incorporates all available information into prices,
  * meaning it is impossible to consistently “beat the market” using public information.
* In practice, bubbles show that **psychological biases** and collective narratives can drive prices far from fundamentals.

## 4. Media Turning Point (2005)

* **The Economist (June 2005)**: cover story warning of house prices “falling like a brick,” before any actual decline had started.
* **Time Magazine (2005)**: raised the question “Will your house make you rich?” and openly discussed the case for renting.
* **Barron’s (2005)**: interview with Shiller predicting a possible **50% decline** (the real figure was closer to \~40% inflation-adjusted).
* Outcome: the psychological climate shifted → home buying was no longer seen as an obvious, risk-free decision.

## 5. Post-Crisis Consequences

* By 2012, the **spread between mortgage costs and expected appreciation had disappeared**.

  * Price growth expectations ≈ 0%, sometimes negative.
  * Mortgage rates had declined, but expectations had fallen even faster.
* Conclusion: **buying was no longer a “good deal.”**
* Many young people increasingly turned to **renting** (urban lifestyles, lower optimism, cultural shift away from ownership).

## 6. International Extension – China

* Signs of overheating:

  * Extremely high **price-to-income** and **price-to-rent ratios**.
  * **Parents financing purchases** for children.
  * Social pressures (housing as a prerequisite for marriage).
  * **Limited ability to invest abroad** → domestic capital concentrated in real estate.

* Chinese specificities:

  * Fear of corruption → preference for tangible assets like housing.
  * Male-female imbalance → families buy homes to increase marriage prospects for sons.
  * Rapid economic growth → belief that Beijing or Shanghai could soon rival the world’s most expensive cities.

* Risks: economic slowdown and possible liberalization of foreign investment could trigger corrections.

## 7. About Robert Shiller

* Robert J. **Shiller** is the professor of this Yale course.
* Nobel Prize in Economics (2013), known for:

  * the **Case-Shiller Home Price Index**,
  * pioneering work on **speculative bubbles**,
  * and **behavioral finance**, highlighting the role of narratives and human biases in markets.

---

**Key Insight**: The U.S. housing bubble shows how **unrealistic expectations**, amplified by **leverage and tax incentives**, can become a collective belief until the media narrative flips.
China demonstrates that the **same psychological dynamics** can emerge elsewhere, shaped by local cultural and institutional factors.

# [Salon Bubbles]


## 1. Why invest in a bubble?

* Even if an investor suspects a bubble, the market can keep rising.
* Shorting a bubble is difficult:

  * In housing, you cannot short a house.
  * In stocks, the downturn can take years → short sellers risk bankruptcy.
* Financial advisors who recommend staying out of the market may lose their clients before the bubble bursts.

---

## 2. Origin and definition of the term

* The word **bubble** was coined in 1720 during a stock market crash in France.
* A bubble = **speculative rise driven by social contagion**:

  * good news spreads, bad news is ignored,
  * prices rise, attracting more buyers,
  * eventually doubters appear, and the fall accelerates.
* Long rejected by economists, the term became accepted after the 2007–2009 crisis.

---

## 3. Metaphor: bubble or epidemic?

* Unlike a soap bubble, a financial bubble does not vanish completely. Prices can rise again.
* Shiller suggests the term **“epidemic”** is more accurate:

  * contagious spread of stories and beliefs,
  * narratives and theories “mutate” like viruses (political statements, economic news).

---

## 4. Why was the 2000s housing bubble so massive?

* Real estate boom was global: United States, China, Spain, Italy, UK, Ireland, Iceland…
* Key factor: dominance of the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**.

  * Previously, leaders sometimes warned against excesses.
  * Under EMH, criticizing the market seemed “unscientific.”
  * Result: absence of counter-narratives allowed bubbles to grow unchecked.
* The so-called “smart money” assumed to stabilize markets was far less visible in practice.

---

## 5. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

* **Definition**: asset prices fully reflect all available information. It is impossible to consistently beat the market.
* **Three forms**:

  1. Weak: prices reflect past data.
  2. Semi-strong: prices reflect all public information.
  3. Strong: prices reflect even insider information.
* **Critiques**: bubbles, crashes, and anomalies (momentum, value, etc.) contradict EMH.
* Behavioral finance (Shiller, Kahneman, Tversky) highlights the role of psychology and social contagion.

---

## 6. Rational bubble?

* Some theorists argue for the possibility of a **rational bubble**: investors ride the rise before the crash.
* In practice: extremely risky.

  * Very difficult to time the turning point.
  * Strong hindsight bias makes events seem “obvious” after the fact.

---

## 7. The role of short selling

* Foundational article: Edward Miller (1970s).

  * Without short selling, nothing prevents “fanatics” from pushing prices to absurd levels.
* Practical limits:

  * not all shares are available for shorting,
  * regulatory restrictions (e.g. China),
  * housing cannot be shorted directly.
* Attempts: futures and options markets on real estate (CME in the U.S., IPD in London).

  * Low liquidity, high risk.
  * Being a short seller is inherently dangerous.

---

## 8. Conclusion

* Bubbles are **collective and contagious phenomena**, better understood as social epidemics than as simple price anomalies.
* The lack of effective mechanisms to counter speculative excess (limited short selling) challenges the idea of fully **efficient markets**.

# [ Regulation Overview]



## 1. Context: Crises, Misbehavior, and Regulation

* Financial regulation aims to deal with **human problems, manipulation, and deception**.
* In *Phishing for Phools* (Shiller & Akerlof), “phishing” means exploiting people’s psychological biases.
* Example: **\$9.99 vs \$10 pricing**.

  * Why? Consumers perceive \$9.99 as much cheaper than \$10 because they focus on the first digit.
  * This is a **psychological trick**.
* Firms don’t necessarily want to manipulate, but in a **competitive market with thin margins**, they are **forced to adopt these tricks** because:

  1. If they don’t, competitors will.
  2. Refusing to play the game risks losing customers and going out of business.

→ This creates what Shiller calls a **Phishing Equilibrium**: manipulation becomes the norm, even if no one really wants it.

---

## 2. The Phishing Equilibrium

* In highly competitive markets, companies are trapped into using manipulative strategies.
* Example: Shiller’s company once debated whether to price at **\$29.99 or \$30**.

  * Since they had no competitors at that time, they chose \$30.
  * But in a crowded market, refusing to play the “\$9.99 game” would have been unsustainable.
* Conclusion: **manipulation is not always a choice—it’s imposed by competition**.

---

## 3. Microprudential vs. Macroprudential Regulation

* **Microprudential regulation**: protects individual investors and consumers from abuse.
* **Macroprudential regulation**: prevents large-scale systemic crises that threaten the entire economy.

  * This shift became central after the 2008 financial crisis.
* Today, regulation is not only about individual protection but also about **systemic stability**.

---

## 4. Why Businesses Want Regulation

* Businesses may oppose specific rules that hurt their short-term interests.
* But overall, **firms benefit from regulation** because:

  * It prevents a “race to the bottom” where only the most manipulative survive.
  * It creates a fairer playing field.
* Analogy: **sports referees**.

  * Players complain when fouled, but they want referees to ensure fair play and prevent dangerous behavior.

---

## 5. Trade-Off and Balance

* Regulation lowers systemic risks but can also **slow down innovation** and impose compliance costs.
* Shiller’s view: regulators he met were competent and public-spirited.
* The key challenge: finding the **right balance** between protecting society and allowing entrepreneurship to thrive.

# Within Firm Regulation (Part 1)

## 1. Five Levels of Financial Regulation

* **Within-firm regulation**
* **Trade groups** (industry associations)
* **Local government regulation**
* **National government regulation**
* **International regulation**

This lecture focuses on the **first level: within-firm regulation**.

---

## 2. Role of the Board of Directors

* Standard practice worldwide.
* Usually includes **outside directors** from different professional backgrounds.
* Responsibilities: **hire and fire the president/CEO**.
* Typically a **part-time role** – directors are active in other areas, bringing perspective.
* Chosen for their **reputation and credibility**, which helps protect against misconduct.

---

## 3. Safeguards Against Misconduct

* Directors are selected to avoid individuals with **antisocial or untrustworthy traits**.
* **Reputation matters**: credible directors won’t risk it by allowing devious practices.
* This reputation-based governance helps prevent fraud and manipulation.
* Example of misconduct: **tunneling**.

---

## 4. The Concept of “Tunneling”

* Defined in **Johnson, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2000)**.
* Means **expropriation** by minority shareholders, directors, or officers.
* Comparable to stealing money **through an underground tunnel**.
* A subtle form of fraud that’s difficult to disentangle.

---

## 5. Common Law vs Civil Law in Preventing Tunneling

* **Common Law** (U.S., U.K.):

  * Courts create precedent-based law in addition to legislation.
  * Judges decide on **specific disputes**, making them close to real human issues.
  * More effective in handling tunneling cases.
* **Civil Law** (continental Europe):

  * Law is entirely legislative, no precedent.
  * Less flexible → tunneling more frequent.
* Conclusion (Johnson et al.): **Tunneling is more common in civil law countries.**
* **Key advantage**: Common law systems (U.S., U.K.) provide stronger protection against tunneling and corporate abuse.

---

**Key Takeaway**: Within-firm regulation relies on **corporate governance** (boards with credible directors) and is reinforced by the **legal system**. Common law systems appear better equipped to prevent subtle corporate fraud like tunneling.


#[ Within Firm Regulation, part 2 ]

## 1. The Concept of “Tunneling”

* **Definition**: Extracting value from a company by insiders (controlling shareholders, executives) at the expense of minority shareholders.
* **Common methods**:

  * Selling assets **below market value** to cronies (e.g., a factory sold at 20% of its real value).
  * **Overpriced contracts** with friends’ or family businesses (e.g., paying 3× the market price).
  * **Overly complex contracts** (e.g., 1,000 pages) so shareholders cannot detect overpricing.
  * **Excessive executive compensation**, justified by artificially inflated reputation.
  * **Loan guarantees or inter-company loans** that benefit friends’ companies (knowing repayment will never happen).
  * **Expropriation of corporate opportunities** (CEO diverts new business opportunities to a friend instead of the company).
  * **Dilutive share issues**, reducing existing shareholders’ value.
  * **Insider trading**: buying before good news, selling before bad news.

---

## 2. Duties of Directors

* **Duty of care**: act as a prudent, reasonable person would in managing the company.
* **Duty of loyalty**: avoid conflicts of interest, prevent insiders from benefiting at shareholders’ expense.
* Loyalty is not just a moral principle — it is a **legal obligation**.

---

## 3. Case Study: France

* **SARL Peronnet case**: Company leased a warehouse from the Peronnet family (owners) at an inflated price.
* Minority shareholders sued, alleging tunneling.
* French court dismissed the case, ruling that the contract had a legitimate purpose and that judges cannot decide if the price was “too high.”
* **Result**: tunneling was successful.
* **Contrast**: In the U.S. or U.K., courts would be more likely to treat this as tunneling → explains stronger stock market development in Anglo-Saxon countries.

---

## 4. Limits and Risks of Regulation

* **Too much regulation** = high compliance costs, discourages firms from growing beyond certain thresholds.
* **Corrupt regulators** = risk of regulatory capture (needing bribes).
* Balance is required: regulate without paralyzing business activity.

---

## 5. Spirit of Regulation

* Regulators should act with a **professional mission to serve society**, not as insensitive bureaucrats.
* Well-designed regulation is **essential** for a modern economy.

# README – Market Makers, Brokers, Spreads & VPIN

## 1. From Fixed Commissions to Zero Commission

* **Before 1975 (US) / 1986 (UK):**
  Brokers charged a **fixed commission** (e.g., 0.25% per trade).
  No competition, investors always paid the same fee.

* **After deregulation:**
  Brokers competed on price → **discount brokers** appeared.
  Online brokers drove commissions down.

* **Today:**
  Many brokers (Robinhood, Trade Republic, etc.) offer **zero commission** on stocks/ETFs.

👉 But **“zero commission” ≠ free trading**. The real cost is hidden in **spreads, PFOF, and execution quality**.

---

## 2. The Broker ↔ Market Maker Relationship

1. **Investor (you):** sends a buy/sell order via a retail broker.
2. **Broker:** instead of routing directly to the exchange, it sells the order flow to a **Market Maker (MM)** via **Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)**.
3. **Market Maker:** executes your order at the quoted bid/ask and pays the broker for sending it.
4. **Result:**

   * Investor sees “zero commission.”
   * Broker earns from PFOF.
   * MM profits from the **spread**.

---

## 3. How Market Makers Operate

* **Bid/Ask quotes:**
  *Bid = price MM buys at; Ask = price MM sells at.*
  Spread = Ask − Bid.

* **Example:**
  *Bid = \$100.00, Ask = \$100.05.*
  Retail buys 100 shares at \$100.05 → MM immediately hedges at \$100.00.
  Profit = \$0.05 × 100 = **\$5**.

* **Other revenue sources:**

  * Internalization (matching buyers/sellers inside their own book).
  * Exchange rebates for liquidity provision.
  * Statistical models from order flow.

---

## 4. Order Flow Toxicity (OFT)

* **Non-toxic flow (retail):**

  * Small orders, market orders, intuitive trading.
  * No hidden information → predictable, safe for MM.
  * MM captures spread consistently.

* **Toxic flow (informed traders, HFT, hedge funds):**

  * Large, fast, data-driven orders.
  * Often arrive just before price moves.
  * MM loses money if quoting too tight → widens spreads, reduces size, reprices faster.

👉 For MMs, retail flow = gold. Institutional flow = risk.

---

## 5. VPIN – Volume-synchronized Probability of Informed Trading

### 1) Core idea

VPIN measures whether **buyers strongly outweigh sellers** (or vice versa) in a given period.

* Balanced flow → low risk (likely retail).
* Imbalanced flow → high risk (likely informed).

👉 High VPIN = higher probability of trading against informed flow.

---

### 2) Step-by-step calculation

**Step 1 – Classify volume (Bulk Volume Classification)**

* If price ↑ → classify volume as **buy**.
* If price ↓ → classify volume as **sell**.
* If price = unchanged → split 50/50.

**Step 2 – Build “volume buckets”**

* Example: bucket size = 2,000 contracts.
* Accumulate trades until reaching bucket size → 1 bucket.

**Step 3 – Measure imbalance**

* Example: 1,200 buys vs 800 sells in a 2,000 bucket.
* Imbalance = |1200 − 800| = 400.
* Ratio = 400 / 2000 = **0.20 (20%)**.

**Step 4 – Smooth over multiple buckets**

* Take the average of the last *N* bucket ratios (e.g., N=50).
* That rolling average = **VPIN**.

---

### 3) Simplified example

3 buckets of 1000 contracts each:

| Bucket | Buys | Sells | Imbalance | Ratio |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | --------- | ----- |
| 1      | 600  | 400   | 200       | 0.20  |
| 2      | 800  | 200   | 600       | 0.60  |
| 3      | 500  | 500   | 0         | 0.00  |

* VPIN = (0.20 + 0.60 + 0.00) / 3 = **0.27**
  👉 Flow shows elevated toxicity, mainly due to bucket 2.

---

### 4) Intuition (fruit market metaphor)

Imagine a fruit market 🍎🍌:

* Normally, buyers ≈ sellers → stable.
* Suddenly, way more buyers than sellers → something is going on (hidden info?) → high risk for sellers.

---

### 5) Practical interpretation

* **Low VPIN (e.g., 0.05–0.10):** calm market, balanced flow, tight spreads.
* **High VPIN (e.g., 0.25–0.40+):** imbalanced flow, likely informed traders, spreads widen.

---

## 6. Retail Strategies with VPIN

* **Risk filter:**

  * Avoid entering against the flow when VPIN is high.
  * Reduce size or stay flat in toxic flow periods.

* **Momentum follow:**

  * If VPIN spikes → institutions may be buying/selling aggressively.
  * Retail can follow the imbalance direction (short-term momentum), but must exit quickly.

* **Setup filter:**

  * Combine VPIN with breakouts, SMC zones, or news.
  * Breakout + high VPIN = stronger conviction.

👉 Realistically: retail cannot beat HFT in speed, but VPIN can be a **context tool** to avoid traps and catch durable moves.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

* Brokers make money from **PFOF**, not commissions.
* Market makers profit from **the spread**, but risk losses if flow is toxic.
* **Order Flow Toxicity** explains why retail flow is valuable and institutional flow is risky.
* **VPIN** is a practical metric to measure imbalance and probability of informed trading.
* For retail, VPIN works best as a **risk filter and momentum context indicator**, not a standalone alpha signal.

---

👉 Next step: VPIN can be coded easily in **Python** (good for backtesting and retail strategies).
C++ is only needed for **ultra-low latency HFT**.
