[Salon - Recessions]
Here’s a clean **README-style draft** for your GitHub:

### 1. Nature of Recessions

* According to Robert Shiller (*Animal Spirits*, with George Akerlof), recessions are **largely psychological**.
* Similar to depression: even with intervention from a central bank or government, recovery is not immediate.

### 2. Inverted Yield Curves

* Occur when **short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates**.
* Normally, long-term rates are higher due to greater risk.
* Historically, an inverted yield curve has been a **leading indicator of recessions**.
* Explanations include:

  * **Long-term pessimism**: investors expect weak growth and low investment (examples: Japan, Germany).
  * **Central bank tightening**: in the past, central banks raised short-term rates sharply to fight inflation, often triggering recessions.

### 3. Other Indicators

* **Stock market**: the most widely recognized leading indicator.

  * Examples: 1929, 2000, 2007 → significant declines preceded recessions.
  * Acts as a **self-fulfilling prophecy**: falling markets increase fear, reduce spending and investment, and deepen downturns.
* **Bond market spreads** (e.g., LIBOR–OIS) can show stress but are generally less predictive than equities.

### 4. Forecasting Challenges

* Recessions are **difficult to forecast** until clear signs such as rising unemployment appear.
* Similar to predicting whether a movie will succeed: public sentiment and collective psychology drive outcomes.
* Conclusion: indicators can sometimes give signals, but **never with full reliability**.


[History of Mortgage Lending]

Mortgage lending is one of the oldest forms of credit. Its history highlights how collateral, property law, and financial institutions evolved to support real estate markets.

## Origins

* The word **mortgage** comes from the Latin *mort* (death), meaning *dead pledge*.
* Collateral has existed for centuries: if the borrower fails to repay, the lender can sell the pledged property.

## Modern Concept

* To **mortgage a house** means to pledge it as collateral in exchange for a loan.
* If the borrower defaults, the bank repossesses and sells the property.
* The loan depends more on the **value of the property** than on the trustworthiness of the borrower.

## Historical Development

* **Tang Dynasty (China):** Relatives could be fined if the borrower defaulted.
* **18th Century (Europe):** Property ownership was unclear. People posted newspaper ads to claim rights, often leading to disputes.
* **Late 19th Century (Germany):** Introduction of the **Grundbuch**, a centralized registry of property ownership, which improved legal clarity and reduced fraud.

## Key Takeaways

* Mortgage lending enabled large-scale real estate financing.
* Clear and reliable property registration is essential for stable credit markets.
* Systems like the **Grundbuch** shaped the foundation of today’s modern property laws.


[Commercial Real Estate Vehicles]
Perfect — here’s the same README **in English** for your GitHub:

---

# Commercial Real Estate Vehicles – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. Real Estate Partnerships (DPP – Direct Participation Programs)

* Available only to **accredited investors** (SEC criteria):

  * Net worth > \$1M (excluding primary residence)
  * or annual income > \$200k
* Structured as a **limited partnership**:

  * **General Partner**: manages the business, has unlimited liability, must hold at least 1%.
  * **Limited Partners**: passive investors, limited liability.
* **Tax advantage**: profits flow through to investors (no corporate tax).
* Limitation: must have a **finite life** (not perpetual).
* Example: purchase an apartment building, operate for 20 years, then sell and liquidate.

## 2. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

* Created in **1960 by U.S. Congress** to give small investors access to real estate.
* Benefit from **pass-through taxation** (no corporate profits tax) but must follow strict rules:

  * 75% of assets in real estate or cash.
  * 75% of income from real estate.
  * 90% of income distributed to shareholders.
  * Max 30% of income from sales of properties held < 4 years.
* Have grown significantly, adopted worldwide.
* Can specialize by type: e.g., **golf course REITs**, retail REITs, etc.

## 3. Historical REIT Cycles

* **1960s**: Initial boom, followed by real estate downturn.
* **1986**: Tax reform reduced partnership advantages → REITs gained traction.
* **1992**: Third boom, rise of specialized REITs.

## 4. Housing Prices – Key Drivers

* **Classical view**: driven by construction costs.
* **Modern reality**: heavily influenced by **psychology and speculation** → bubbles.
* Structural factors: scarcity of space (e.g., Manhattan, Los Angeles), glamour appeal.
* Political/economic factors: **free market revolution** (Thatcher, Reagan, Deng Xiaoping) → widespread fear of housing scarcity and rising unaffordability.

[Mortgages, part 1]

# Mortgages, Part 1 – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. Overview of the U.S. Mortgage Market

* Total mortgage debt held by households: **\$13.2 trillion** (recent figure).
* About **48 million mortgaged homes** in the U.S. (\~1 per 6–7 people).
* After the **2008 financial crisis**, nearly **11 million homes (1 in 5)** were “underwater” (home value < mortgage).

### Jingle Mail

* Homeowners in negative equity could abandon homes by mailing back the keys (“jingle mail”).
* Works mainly in **non-recourse states** (lender cannot pursue assets beyond the house).
* In recourse states, lenders *can* pursue further claims but often don’t (too costly).

---

## 2. Impact of Negative Equity on the Economy

* Many households, especially young families, hold most of their wealth in their house.
* When underwater → **negative net worth** → families stopped spending.
* Led to sharp contraction in consumer spending → worsened recession.

---

## 3. Evolution of Mortgage Structures

* **Pre-1930s**: mortgages were short-term (2–5 years).

  * Homeowners relied on refinancing at maturity.
  * During the **Great Depression**: unemployment + housing crash → banks refused renewals → mass foreclosures.
* **1934**: Roosevelt administration created the **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**.

  * FHA **insured banks** against borrower default.
  * Introduced **long-term mortgages** (15 years minimum, later 30 years became standard).
  * Objective: stabilize the housing market and restore lending.

---

## 4. FHA and Long-Term Trends

* FHA still active but has faced solvency issues after waves of defaults.
* Insurance premiums increased (from 0.5% → 1.5% annually).
* 30-year mortgages became the **norm in the U.S.**, especially for younger buyers.

---

## 5. Overvaluation vs. Undervaluation of Housing

* Public focus often on **housing bubbles** (overvaluation).
* But **undervaluation** is also an issue:

  * Examples: Detroit, parts of Baltimore.
  * Homes priced **below construction cost** → no incentive for new building.
  * Potential for **value investing** if the city recovers (jobs, redevelopment).
* Key idea: prices capped by **construction costs** on the upside, and supported by them on the downside.

[Mortgages, part 2]

## 1. Mortgage Rates and Treasury Yields

* **30-year mortgage rates** closely track the **10-year U.S. Treasury yield**.
* Reason: although mortgages are issued for 30 years, **average life ≈ 10 years** (due to moving, refinancing, selling).
* Hence, mortgage pricing aligns with 10-year yields.
* A **spread** exists between mortgages and Treasuries due to:

  * Credit risk (default risk).
  * Servicing costs (collections, paperwork, insurance).
  * Mortgage insurance (e.g., FHA, \~0.5–1.5%).

---

## 2. Historical Peaks – 1980s Inflation

* 1982: Mortgage rates peaked at **\~19%**.
* Example: a \$300k house → annual mortgage payments \~20% = \$60k/year.
* Result: affordability crisis → **home prices collapsed**.
* Inflation adjusted some of the burden, but cash payments were unsustainable.

---

## 3. Alternative Mortgage Designs

* **PLAM (Price Level Adjusted Mortgage):**

  * Payments adjusted for inflation.
  * Sometimes with *negative amortization* (initial payments below interest, principal rises).
  * Designed for high inflation eras. Rare today.

* **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):**

  * Rate tied to short-term benchmarks (e.g., 1-year Treasury + spread).
  * Payments fluctuate with market interest rates.

* **Shared Appreciation Mortgages (SAMs):**

  * Borrower pays lender a share of the property’s appreciation instead of (or in addition to) interest.
  * Popular in the UK in the 1990s–2000s but fell out of favor when housing boomed.

* **Home Equity Loans / Second Mortgages:**

  * Borrowing against home value for consumption (renovations, vacations).
  * Expanded pre-2008 → households became overleveraged.

---

## 4. Inflation and Housing Markets

* Late 1970s–early 1980s: **double-digit inflation** (12%+).
* Fed (under **Paul Volcker**) raised interest rates aggressively.
* Result: mortgage rates >18%, housing prices dropped to extreme lows.
* Without inflation-adjusted mortgages (like PLAMs), affordability collapsed.
* Prices later recovered once inflation and interest rates declined.

[PMI, CMOs, CDOs] 

# PMI, CMOs, and CDOs – Yale University (Coursera)

## 1. PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)

* Introduced alongside **FHA insurance (1934)** and **VA insurance (post-WWII)**.
* **Purpose**: protects lenders if borrower defaults.
* **Who pays?** The *borrower (homeowner)* pays PMI if down payment < 20% of home value.

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Rule

* **Definition**:

  $$
  \text{LTV} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Property Value}} \times 100
  $$
* **When required**: PMI applies if **LTV > 80%** (borrower’s equity < 20%).
* **Cancellation**:

  * Borrower may **request cancellation** once LTV ≤ 80% (with good payment history and possibly a new appraisal).
  * PMI must be **automatically terminated** at **78% LTV** (per the original amortization schedule, assuming payments are current).
  * Final termination rule: PMI must end by the **midpoint of the loan term** if not canceled earlier.

### Issues

* Lenders rarely notify borrowers when PMI is no longer required (≤ 80% LTV).
* Many homeowners **overpay for years** unless they proactively request cancellation.
* Some PMI companies collapsed during the financial crisis (e.g., PMI Group Inc.).

## 2. CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations)

* **Process**:

  * Banks originate mortgages → sell them to investors as securities.
  * Mortgages pooled together → structured into **tranches** (slices).
* **Tranches**:

  * **Senior tranche (AAA)**: gets paid first, least risky.
  * **Mezzanine tranches (AA, A, BBB, etc.)**: higher risk, higher yield.
  * **Equity tranche ("toxic waste")**: absorbs first losses, very risky. Sometimes bought by hedge funds at deep discounts.
* **Benefit**: Allows creation of **AAA-rated securities** from risky mortgage pools.

---

## 3. CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)

* Similar to CMOs but broader:

  * Can include not just mortgages, but also **auto loans, credit card debt, corporate loans**, etc.
  * Also structured into tranches with varying levels of risk.
* Both **CMOs and CDOs** became central to the **2007–2009 financial crisis**:

  * Defaults reached into supposedly “safe” senior tranches.
  * Rating agencies had overrated securities (AAA ratings proved unreliable).

---

## 4. Crisis Lessons

* During the financial crisis, **AAA tranches lost value**, but often not as catastrophically as markets feared.
* In 2009, beaten-down CMOs and CDOs were **undervalued opportunities** for smart investors.
* Key insight: markets are **not fully efficient**, especially in crises.
* **Smart money** (with institutional knowledge) bought distressed assets when panic selling pushed prices too low.
