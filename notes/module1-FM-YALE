Author Quotes : " if you help people manage risks, they will take more risks. That's what we want. We want people, in their decisions about their education, to do some risk-taking. Develop some specialty that is at risk of being obsolete, but who knows, nobody knows. You're taking a chance. Let's encourage people to take chances."

**Almost every human activity that's useful and important needs financing**

[VaR]: Value at Risk, a **risk management metric** used to estimate how much you could potentially lose on investment or portfolio, over a specific time period with a given level of confidence.
We can calculate VaR by using 3 main a.historical simulation, b.variance-covariance ( Parametric VaR), c.Monte Carlo
a.historical simulation : Uses actual historical returns to simulate potential future losses.
b.Parametric VaR : Assumes returns follow a normal distribution. Fast, but less flexible.
VaR=Zα×σ×V
Zα : z-score for the confidence level (1.65 for 95%, 2.33 for 99%) / σ: σ = standard deviation (volatility) of returns/ V = portfolio value
c.Monte Carlo : Generates thousands of random scenarios. Powerful but computationally heavy.

[Stress Tests] (a faire plus tard sur algo trading 30 ) : originally it was refered to the medical procedure of cardiovascular activity after effort, to see how the cardiovascular system reacts, now it's turned on finance to identify vulnerabilities, resiliency and anticipate the impact of worst case scenarios.
[VAR] : Variance is the standard deviation of an asset's return. Variance measures the dispersion of an asset’s returns around its mean. It quantifies the degree of risk or volatility associated with the asset. The higher the variance, the more volatile (unstable) the returns are which means the investment is riskier.

[SP500]
" voir scatter with regression line"
[Beta of a stock]: Beta measures how sensitive a stock is to movements in the overall market. 
β = 1: same volatility, β > 1: more volatile, β < 1: less volatile).
Beta represents the systematic risk (market related risk) of an asset.
[CAPM] : Capital Asset Pricing Model, The CAPM is a model used to calculate the **expected return** of a stock based on its risk.
It uses beta to link this risk to the expected return.
**Expected Return** =Rf+β×(Rm−Rf)
Rf:risk-free rate
Rm: market return

[Systematic Risk (Market Risk)] : unavoidable risk, related to the market
[Idiosyncratic Risk] :Specific or Unsystematic Risk, specific to a single company or industry. we can reduce this risk by diversifying the portfolio

[Regression line ] : statistical tool that models the relationship between two variables.
in finance, it's commonly used to: Estimate the beta of a stock (relationship between a stock’s return and the market’s return).
Y=α+βX+ε
Y = Dependent variable (e.g., stock return)
X = Independent variable (e.g., market return)
α = Intercept (also called Jensen’s alpha in finance), it's te stock return if the market doesnt move, if the the X is 0. It shows the added value of a stock independant of the market.
β = Slope of the line → measures sensitivity (beta)
ε = Random error (what the model doesn’t explain)


[normal Distribution] : Calm market, most price movements are small, extreme risks are rare
[valeurs aberrantes, valeur extreme, outlier]: a single extreme value, an isolated point far from the rest.
[Cauchy distribution] Heavy tail :Turbulent market, extreme price movements are frequent and significant events are more likely.
[Heavy tail] : a global phenomenon meaning there are more outliers in the tails of the distribution than expected under a normal distribution
[Central limit theorem (CLT)]: The average of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables with finite variance follows a normal distribution, even if the original data are not normal.
Key points:
Works when: independence + identical distribution + finite variance + large sample size
Usefulness: allows using the normal distribution to analyze averages
Fails if: infinite variance (e.g., Cauchy distribution), dependence, or too small sample size
Original data	           →   The individual values you observe	( Daily returns of a stock (e.g., +1%, -0.5%) )
Identically distributed	 →   All data come from the same “source” or pattern	(Each daily return follows the same statistical rule (same mean, volatility) )
Independence	           → Data points don’t influence each other	(Today’s return doesn’t directly affect tomorrow’s return) 
Finite variance	         → No uncontrollable extreme values	Returns don’t have “crazy” infinite jumps too often
Large sample             → size	Lots of data points	 (Many days of returns observed, e.g., 1000 trading days )

[COVARIANCE] : A statistical measure that indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It shows whether the variables tend to increase or decrease together (positive covariance), move in opposite directions (negative covariance), or have no consistent pattern (covariance close to zero).
> 0 (positive)	→ 𝑋 and Y move in the same direction
< 0 (negative)	→ X and Y move in opposite directions
= 0	            → No visible linear relationship
close to 0	    → Weak or almost no relationship
Generally, a portfolio should have assets with low or negative covariances between them in order to diversify the risk
An investor should consider a lot the COV.
Gold acts as a hedge against systemic risk thanks to its low or negative covariance with other assets during crises, reducing overall volatility and improving portfolio resilience.

[INSURANCE FUNDAMENTALS]
[Risk Pooling], the source of all value in insurance, Insurance companies use the Law of Large Numbers to predict how many losses will occur in a large group. By pooling individual risks together, they make total losses more stable and predictable. This makes the insurance business, overall, not very risky.
  [Life insurance] model. the risk is low when N is high (SD formula)
[Crop insurance], did not work well because of farm lies and cheat on yhe yield then insurance company decided to insure the weather instead of the crop because the farmer can't cheat on the weather.
[Flood insurance] has been created to avoid people to build houses on floodplains

[Insurance Milestones]
[Combination of isurance and saving in life insurance] : you lose the cash value if you stop paying your insurance, its a saving vehicule

[Insurance is a Local Phenomenon]
US government set insurance fund guarantee to protect the people in case their insurance goes bankrupcy. China set up the same, limited to pay 50k in case of insurance company failure

[Health Insurance]
Obama care made it mandatory for individual to pay insurance otherwise they would face fine

[Disaster]
before 9/11 insurance did not exclude terrorism risk because they didn't ccinsidare it as a consequential risk
in 2002, government required insurance to offer terroris insurance
2015 this act was renewed to 2020. it is still no permanent. the next will expire in 2027. Congress reviews and reauthorizes based on need

[Eggs in One Basket]
Managing risk through diversification, variety of assets. Mean and variance of portfolio matter

[Salon-Risk]
Hedge funds are not well known; they do not advertise( exept by private conversation) to protect their strategies, but above all because they are not allowed by the regulatory authorities to do so. not approve to retail investor but by accreditated ones.
Black Swan, Taleb. Model to measure risk are flawed because they do not take into account rare and unlikely (low probability) events. we do not have enough data to properly analyse those rare and events so it's a problem
