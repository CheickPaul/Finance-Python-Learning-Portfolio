# Finance & Python Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my study journey across **finance certificates** to prepare for master and roles in **quantitative finance, trading, and research**.

## Objective
Connect **market theory, portfolio construction, and algorithmic trading** with **hands on Python**.  
Each line links a certificate to a reference text and a concrete outcome.
