# Finance & Python Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my structured development in financial markets, portfolio management, and applied quantitative tools in preparation for graduate studies in finance.

The objective is to connect market theory with practical implementation using Python.

## Objective

Bridge financial concepts — macroeconomics, fixed income, derivatives, and portfolio construction — with structured analytical applications.

Each module focuses on conceptual clarity before implementation.
