# Lesson 9 – Finance and Population Growth

## Key Concepts
- Thomas Malthus (1798): “Dismal Law of Economics”.
  - Population grows geometrically (~doubling every 25 years).
  - Food/resources grow arithmetically (much slower).
  - Subsistence improvements offset by more people → recurrent scarcity.
- Malthusian Trap:
  - Historical societies hovered near starvation.
  - Gains in living standards often triggered more population growth.
  - Core message: long-run poverty is unavoidable.
- Critique / Modern View:
  - Logically strong but pessimistic.
  - May apply in the very long run, but misleading for current times.
  - Human creativity, technology, and finance expand resource capacity beyond Malthus’ limits.
- Role of Finance:
  - Allocates resources efficiently.
  - Funds innovation, infrastructure, health → directly counters Malthusian dynamics.
- Ethical Imperative:
  - Even with uncertainty in future centuries, moral duty exists today.
  - Use finance to improve current welfare.
  - Focus on better lives now, not fatalism.

## My Notes
- Malthus offers a useful cautionary lens, but history shows human ingenuity consistently expanding frontiers.
- Finance plays a **pivotal role in innovation funding**, which breaks scarcity cycles.
- Ethical perspective: finance must not just sustain growth, but also enhance fairness and welfare.

## Reflection
I don’t think population growth is a threat to economic stability. Humanity will always find a way to adapt. Technology can allow us to optimize consumption, and we should take advantage of that.

For me, trading is a way to benefit from the financial flows circulating around the world. The real challenge lies in how trading firms use the revenues they generate, especially through the investments they make.

In my view, I earn in the short term to finance projects and support the economy in the long term. I see trading as a way to generate quick gains in order to contribute to economic development (investment in startups, in capital, etc.).

I want my career to be lucrative, but also to give back: by training younger generations, by investing in education, and by supporting local community projects.
