# Lesson 12 – Your Career and Finance

## Key Concepts
- **Wealth, Morality, and Timing**
  - Early gifts have limited impact if income is low.  
  - Strategy: accumulate skills and capital when young, give back later.  
  - Examples: Gates & Buffett’s Giving Pledge; Carnegie’s *Gospel of Wealth*.  

- **Creative Finance for Society**
  - Muhammad Yunus (Grameen Bank, Nobel Prize 2006): microloans for poor entrepreneurs.  
  - Democratizing finance can be profitable and socially impactful.  

- **Future of Financial Capitalism**
  - Markets will be pervasive.  
  - Booms and crashes likely to grow despite regulation (FSB, Dodd-Frank).  
  - IT will reshape products, risks, opportunities.  

- **Randomness, Risk, and Perspective**
  - Think on century scale (self, children, society).  
  - Bias: “what you see is all there is.”  
  - Chance plays a large role in outcomes (Ecclesiastes IX; Taleb’s *Fooled by Randomness*).  
  - Finance manages but cannot eliminate risk.  

- **Career Actions**
  - Invest in human capital: build adaptable skills.  
  - Study risk management & financial theory, combined with practice.  
  - Position relative to historical shifts, not just personal timeline.  
  - Maintain humanity & ethics in finance.  

## My Notes
- Finance is not only about personal success, but also about intergenerational impact.  
- The lesson links career, ethics, and finance together with historical and philosophical references.  
- A strong reminder that **chance and timing** are as important as skill.  
- Career strategy = mix of human capital + long-term moral compass.  

## Reflection

### Wealth & Morality
I believe one should accumulate, save, and give back a portion to associations of their choice. During one’s career, it is important to build a portfolio and practice DCA. At the birth of children, also start a DCA with a money manager for them.  

### Creative Finance
Be active in youth associations and encourage them early on to invest in risk-free assets and to save.  

### Future of Finance
Today, in my view, it is essential to train seriously in AI tools: Machine Learning, Quant, etc.  

### English (King James Version)
I returned, and saw under the sun,  
that the race is not to the swift,  
nor the battle to the strong,  
neither yet bread to the wise,  
nor yet riches to men of understanding,  
nor yet favour to men of skill;  
but time and chance happeneth to them all.
