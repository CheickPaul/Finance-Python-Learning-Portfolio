# Lesson 5 – Critics of Modern Finance

## Key Concepts
- Finance shapes modern life, even for those outside the industry.
- Adair Turner:
  - Ex-LSE professor, former head of UK FSA, now chair at Institute for New Economic Thinking.
  - Concern: debt explosion → domestic credit rose from ~40% of GDP (1950) to ~160% today.
  - Finance’s share of GDP: US grew from ~1% (1850) to ~7% today.
  - Questions whether growth reflects value creation or rent-seeking.
  - Book: *Between Debt and the Devil* (2015) → warns against excessive private debt, suggests alternatives like direct monetary financing.
- Rana Foroohar:
  - Journalist & author of *Makers and Takers* (2016).
  - Argument: finance rewards “takers” (tax avoidance, engineering, rent extraction) instead of “makers” (innovation).
  - Example: Apple post-Steve Jobs borrowed billions despite huge cash reserves → tax optimization > innovation.
  - Notes decline of creativity as finance dominates corporate priorities.
- Main idea: critics don’t reject finance itself, but excesses:
  - Too much leverage and credit growth.
  - Finance’s GDP share outpacing societal contribution.
  - Firms prioritizing rent-seeking over real innovation.

## My Notes
- Both Turner and Foroohar underline that **finance has expanded beyond its productive role**.
- Turner focuses on **macro risk of debt**; Foroohar on **corporate culture distortion**.
- Apple example shows how finance can shift a firm’s DNA from innovation → financial engineering.
- This makes me think about the **difference between innovation-driven and profit-extraction-driven finance**.

## Reflection
Both Turner and Foroohar highlight a central concern: finance should serve the real economy, not dominate it. The challenge is to redirect financial innovation and resources toward productive, socially beneficial activities instead of purely extractive ones.
