# Lesson 1 – Nonprofits

## Key Concepts
- Individuals seek meaning beyond material goods → foundation for nonprofits.
- Nonprofits: no dividends, no shareholders (they own themselves).
- Non-distribution constraint: profits must be reinvested or donated.
- Significant economic weight (10%+ of U.S. workforce, similar in other developed countries).
- Motivations for contributing: altruism, loyalty, religious values, search for meaning.
- Civil society as a tradition (Aristotle, Cicero, Darwin’s voyage).
- Internal management: 42% use executive bonuses to attract talent.
- Role in addressing inequality, providing access to services (e.g., healthcare).

## My Notes
- Nonprofits represent a **third force** in society, different from markets and governments.
- Their strength lies in **trust and mission** rather than profit maximization.
- Interesting tension: no dividends, yet they must compete with for-profit firms for talent → bonus systems.
- They show that **human motivation is multidimensional**, not just self-interest.
- The U.S. nonprofit sector is massive; I didn’t realize it’s larger than some national industries.
- Example: Yale University itself is a nonprofit — prestige + mission-driven.
