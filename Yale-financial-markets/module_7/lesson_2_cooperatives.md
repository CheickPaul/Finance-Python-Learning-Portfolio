# Cooperatives

## Definition
A cooperative is a for-profit business, but different from a regular corporation.  
Key rule: one person = one vote, regardless of the number of shares owned.  
Profits are redistributed to members in proportion to their purchases, not to their shares.  

## Historical Origins
1844, Rochdale (England): the Rochdale Pioneers founded the first cooperative (a grocery store).  

**Rochdale Principles:**
- Voluntary and open membership.  
- Democratic member control.  
- Member economic participation.  
- Surpluses returned as rebates based on purchases.  

Different “spirit” compared to corporations: goal is to serve members, not exploit uninformed customers.  

## Examples
- Yale Cooperative Society (1885): created by Yale students, became the Yale Bookstore (no longer a cooperative today).  
- Many cooperatives eventually fail because of management difficulties and competition.  

## Difference with Corporations
- **Corporations**: goal = maximize profit for shareholders.  
- **Cooperatives**: goal = maximize collective welfare of members.  

**In practice:**
- Coops often sell healthier or community-oriented products.  
- Prices may be higher, product selection smaller.  
- They work best in strong communities with loyalty.  
- Advertising and growth are difficult, margins and wages can be lower.  

## Economic Logic
- Members decide democratically on strategy.  
- Focus is not on maximizing dividends, but on improving group welfare.  
- Spirit is social and community-based, not purely profit-driven.
