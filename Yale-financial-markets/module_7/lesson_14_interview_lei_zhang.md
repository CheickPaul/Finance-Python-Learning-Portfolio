# Lesson 14 – Interview with Lei Zhang (Hillhouse Capital)

## Key Concepts
- Entrepreneurial background: started with small ventures, later founded Hillhouse Capital (2005).  
- Mentorship: worked with David Swensen (Yale Investments Office), translated his book into Chinese.  
- Philosophy: markets are not fully efficient → opportunities for long-term, disciplined investors.  
- Investment evolution:  
  - Early stage → discovering undervalued assets.  
  - Current stage → creating and adding value as an active, growth-oriented investor.  
- Approach: concentrated portfolio (10–20 positions), held for a decade or more.  
- Long-term orientation: patience and volatility tolerance as competitive advantage.  
- Education and philanthropy: strong belief in education as the best investment with compounding social returns.  

## My Notes
- Defines himself as an **entrepreneur-investor**, not just a value investor.  
- Evaluates companies from first principles: ambition of founders, fundamentals, business models.  
- Inspired by Chinese/Taoist philosophy: focus, unconventional thinking, calm in volatility.  
- Hillhouse Capital emphasizes value creation: working with firms to improve, not just holding assets.  
- Education focus:  
  - Built schools, scholarships, libraries in China, India, Southeast Asia.  
  - Aspires to reshape Chinese philanthropy toward open, society-centered giving (beyond family tradition).  
- Views on technology: MOOCs and online education can democratize access to knowledge.  
- Sees human capital as the **best compounding investment** for societies.  
- Key challenges:  
  - Impact of AI on jobs.  
  - Risk of a widening digital divide → technology must be used as an equalizer.  

## Quotable Lines
- “Markets are not perfectly efficient — patient, disciplined investors can create real value.”  
- “The best investment is in education; its returns compound across generations.”  
- “Calmness and focus are strengths in a volatile market environment.”
