# Democratization of Finance

## Definition
Democratization of finance means making financial tools and opportunities accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy.  
Finance should help manage risks for all people and reduce inequality.  

## Example: Crowdfunding
- Platforms like Crowdcube (UK) allow individuals with business ideas to raise money directly from the public.  
- Investors can interact in chat rooms, share opinions, and support creative ideas that traditional banks might reject.  
- Example project: Home ultrasound kit for pregnant women.  

## Regulatory Differences
- **UK regulators**: more open to experimentation.  
- **US regulators**: more cautious, fearing fraud and abuse.  
- Limit of $1 million per year per company on crowdfunding.  
- Individual investment caps:  
  - If income < $100,000 → max $2,000 or 5% of income.  
  - Aggregate limit: $100,000.  

## Benefits
- Access to savings, pensions, insurance, and financing has improved life for ordinary people.  
- Democratization fosters inclusion (e.g., women no longer needing a husband’s approval to manage money).  

## Challenges
- Risk of fraud and manipulation, similar to early telephone investment scams.  
- Regulation is highly complex (e.g., SEC crowdfunding rules run thousands of pages).  
- Progress often has downsides, requiring careful oversight and public consultation.
