# Finance and War

War has always been a recurrent feature of human history, with deep implications for finance. Since finance deals largely with long-term claims, wars and regime changes can disrupt institutions and raise questions about the survival of contracts and property rights.

## Key Historical Examples

### World War I – Reparations
- Germany was defeated in 1918 and reparations were imposed.  
- Instead of confiscating private property or shares, reparations were demanded from the government, to be financed through taxes.  
- Ultimately, reparations were cancelled in the 1920s due to political backlash, meaning private shareholders in German companies kept their assets.  

### World War II – Lessons Learned
- Victors avoided penalizing individuals for their government’s actions.  
- In West Germany, private holdings were preserved.  
- In East Germany, under communist ideology, private property was confiscated. Some restitution occurred only after reunification.  

### Iran (1979 Revolution)
- The Shah was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution.  
- Despite regime hostility to the old order, pensions earned under the Shah were respected by the new regime.  

### South Africa (1994 Transition)
- End of apartheid and transfer of power to a black majority government.  
- Pensions and insurance contracts were left intact, signaling a desire for stability.  

### Confiscation Under Socialist Ideologies
- Leaders such as Lenin, Mao, Cárdenas, Mossadegh, Nasser, and Indira Gandhi used socialist theories to justify expropriation of assets and cancellation of contracts.  

### Japan after World War II
- The US forced Zaibatsu conglomerates (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Yasuda) to sell assets and hold proceeds in nominal yen government bonds.  
- Massive postwar inflation wiped out the value of those bonds, effectively destroying their wealth.  

## General Insights
- **Civil Society Considerations**: Often, even hostile regimes maintain financial claims (pensions, contracts) to preserve social trust and stability.  
- **Exceptions**: Socialist or revolutionary ideologies sometimes justify confiscation.  
- **Odious Debt**: Debt incurred by governments for illegitimate or abusive purposes is more likely to be repudiated after regime change.  
- **Ethical Basis of Finance**: The survival of financial claims depends not only on legal enforcement but also on civil society’s perception of fairness and legitimacy.  

## Takeaway
War creates uncertainty for finance, but history shows that individual property rights are often preserved—except when ideologies justify expropriation. For long-term investors, it is crucial to evaluate not only financial metrics but also the moral and political context of issuers, since civil society ultimately decides the legitimacy of financial contracts.
