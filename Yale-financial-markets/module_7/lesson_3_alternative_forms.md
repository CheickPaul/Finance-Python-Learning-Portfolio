# [Alternative Forms Benefit Corporations] 

## Origin
- First created in **Maryland (2010)**.  
- Corporate law is state-based in the U.S., so each state must adopt it individually.  
- Rapidly spreading across many states.  

## Nature
- A **hybrid** between **for-profit** and **nonprofit**.  
- Dual mission:  
  - **Profit-making** (like a for-profit).  
  - **Social or environmental purpose** stated in the charter (like a nonprofit).  

## Example
- **Grower’s Secret** (fertilizer company).  
- Mission: restore the **NPK balance** (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) in ecosystems.  
- Their products reduce harmful fertilizer runoff that contaminates rivers and oceans.  

## Difference from Traditional Companies
- Normal companies may engage in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), but not as a legal obligation.  
- Benefit corporations have their **dual purpose embedded in their charter**.  

## Impact on Corporate Culture
- Creates a **different spirit**, closer to nonprofits.  
- Focus on doing the **right thing**, not only maximizing profit.  

## Current Stage
- Still relatively new (created in 2010).  
- Too early to judge long-term success, but growth is promising.  

## Broader Theme
- **Finance evolves through innovation.**  
- Just as worker’s compensation laws spread in the past, benefit corporations may represent a new wave.  
- Financial systems must consider **human psychology and social context**:  
  - Humans are not always rational.  
  - Finance should integrate values, community, and environmental needs.
