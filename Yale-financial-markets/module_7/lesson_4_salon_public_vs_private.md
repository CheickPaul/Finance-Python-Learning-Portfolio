# Public vs. Private

## Overview
There are long-standing views about which activities are better handled by governments versus the private sector. Education is often government-run; industries like steel are typically private. Governments may be better at handling sensitive externalities and politically delicate human issues—yet no structure is immune to problems.

## Institutional Forms

### Government vs. Private
- Government-run sectors: favored where public externalities and welfare concerns dominate.  
- Private sectors: favored in competitive, industrial activities where profit incentives drive efficiency.  

### The “In-Between”: Nonprofits
Institutions like Yale University exemplify nonprofit organizations—neither state-run nor for-profit—reflecting diverse human motivations to contribute to society (philanthropy, mission, prestige).  

## Incentives & Corruption Patterns

### State-Owned Enterprises
- Vulnerable to political corruption (e.g., officials diverting funds offshore as insurance against regime change).  

### Private-Sector Firms (Public vs. Private Companies)
- **Public company**: listed on a stock exchange, open to general investors.  
- **Private company**: owned by a small set of shareholders, not listed.  
- Private firms can exhibit marketing manipulation and fraud when incentives and oversight are weak.  

## Case Study — Patent Medicines & the Rise of Regulation

**Before ~1900**  
- “Patent medicines” were widely sold without proof of safety or efficacy.  
- Legal recourse existed only in clear, catastrophic cases (e.g., immediate harm), enabling fraudulent products to persist.  

**After Regulation (~1900 onward)**  
- Drug regulation emerged across countries to protect consumers.  
- Today these protections are broadly accepted and seen as essential market infrastructure.  

## Extreme Libertarian View (Rebutted)
The view that firms should not need to prove effectiveness before marketing drugs implies experimenting on the public at scale.  
Shiller rejects this, emphasizing regulatory proof as necessary to safeguard society.
