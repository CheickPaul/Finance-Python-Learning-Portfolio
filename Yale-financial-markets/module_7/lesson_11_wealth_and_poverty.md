# Lesson 11 – Wealth and Poverty

## Key Concepts
- Rising inequality is shaping modern politics across left and right.  
- David Autor (MIT): job losses from globalization/automation → political polarization.  
- Inequality extends beyond economics, driving social and political divides.  
- Communities tied to factories are fragile: closures destroy jobs and home values.  
- Poor families often lack financial advice → miss guidance like “rent, don’t buy.”  
- Current tax incentives for financial advisers benefit mainly the wealthy.  
- Poverty often stems from unmanaged risks → democratizing finance = extending risk management to all.  
- Kahneman & Tversky: “What You See Is All There Is” → people rely only on visible/local info.  
- Misconceptions: “housing always rises,” “buying is always better than renting.”  
- Wealth redistribution often occurs posthumously via institutions, philanthropy, or monuments.  
- Examples:  
  - Mr. Zhang (Chinese Yale alumnus) funded an auditorium young.  
  - J.P. Morgan’s mansion → now a museum.  
- Wealth accumulation fuels cultural legacies, but unevenly distributed.  
- Trade-off: wealth creation comes with inequality (present even in primitive societies).  
- In modern economies, inequality = distribution of opportunities, not survival.  

## My Notes
- Inequality isn’t just an outcome; it reshapes entire societies.  
- Financial literacy gaps amplify risks → wrong housing decisions, poor investments.  
- The wealthy use advisers, the poor often face systemic disadvantage.  
- Wealth can leave legacies beyond families (monuments, universities).  
- The key is finding balance: promoting wealth creation while ensuring fairer opportunity distribution.  

## Reflection
The democratization of finance can truly help reduce inequalities, but only if individuals are willing to learn and accept discipline. Often, poverty results from a lack of discipline: living beyond one’s means, seeking short-term pleasures at the expense of long term investment.  

The role of government in this area is limited. It will not directly subsidize financial advice for low income households. Instead, families, communities, and financial education associations should take responsibility for passing on this knowledge, especially to younger generations by encouraging reading and participation in educational programs.
