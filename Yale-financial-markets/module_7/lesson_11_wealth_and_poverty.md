# Lesson 11 – Wealth and Poverty

## Key Concepts
- Rising inequality is shaping modern politics across left and right.  
- David Autor (MIT): job losses from globalization/automation → political polarization.  
- Inequality extends beyond economics, driving social and political divides.  
- Communities tied to factories are fragile: closures destroy jobs and home values.  
- Poor families often lack financial advice → miss guidance like “rent, don’t buy.”  
- Current tax incentives for financial advisers benefit mainly the wealthy.  
- Poverty often stems from unmanaged risks → democratizing finance = extending risk management to all.  
- Kahneman & Tversky: “What You See Is All There Is” → people rely only on visible/local info.  
- Misconceptions: “housing always rises,” “buying is always better than renting.”  
- Wealth redistribution often occurs posthumously via institutions, philanthropy, or monuments.  
- Examples:  
  - Mr. Zhang (Chinese Yale alumnus) funded an auditorium young.  
  - J.P. Morgan’s mansion → now a museum.  
- Wealth accumulation fuels cultural legacies, but unevenly distributed.  
- Trade-off: wealth creation comes with inequality (present even in primitive societies).  
- In modern economies, inequality = distribution of opportunities, not survival.  

## My Notes
- Inequality isn’t just an outcome; it reshapes entire societies.  
- Financial literacy gaps amplify risks → wrong housing decisions, poor investments.  
- The wealthy use advisers, the poor often face systemic disadvantage.  
- Wealth can leave legacies beyond families (monuments, universities).  
- The key is finding balance: promoting wealth creation while ensuring fairer opportunity distribution.  

## Reflection
The democratization of finance can truly help reduce inequalities, but only if individuals are willing to learn and accept discipline. Often, poverty results from a lack of discipline: living beyond one’s means, seeking short-term pleasures at the expense of long term investment.  

The role of government in this area is limited. It will not directly subsidize financial advice for low-income households. Instead, families, communities, and financial education associations should take responsibility for passing on this knowledge—especially to younger generations—by encouraging reading and participation in educational programs.
