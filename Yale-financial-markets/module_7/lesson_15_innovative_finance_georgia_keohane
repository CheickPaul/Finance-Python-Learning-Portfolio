# Lesson 15 – Innovative Finance (Guest Lecture: Georgia Keohane)

## Introduction
- Guest: **Georgia Levenson Keohane**, Executive Director of the Pershing Square Foundation.  
- Background: work in social change, community and economic development, teaching at Columbia Business School.  
- Author of *Capital and the Common Good*, focused on innovative finance.  
- Theme: how financial tools and technology can be used for **public purpose**.

## Part I – Framing Innovative Finance
- Finance ≠ only speculation or profit → also about **social purpose**.  
- Definition: finance = incentivizing people, managing scarce resources, conveying credible information.  
- Examples of innovative finance in everyday life:  
  - **529 accounts**, **mortgages**, **student loans**, **health insurance** → tools that allow families to invest in education and health.  
- Concept: we all are “bets on the future,” enabled by financial instruments.  
- Natural disaster case:  
  - **Hurricane Sandy** → MTA subway system uninsurable after $5B damage.  
  - Used **catastrophe bonds** (normally private property reinsurance) to finance repairs.  
  - Sparked the broader idea of applying traditional tools to **public infrastructure**.  
- Distinction:  
  - **Financial innovation** = engineering for efficiency/profit (e.g., HFT, CDS, payday lending).  
  - **Innovative finance** = tools designed to solve **market & political failures**, serve underserved populations.

## Part II – Technology, Microfinance & Trust
### Pay-as-You-Go Models
- Kenya: **M-Kopa** (“to borrow” in Swahili) → solar panels financed via mobile payments.  
- Families pay in increments, avoid kerosene costs (~$200/year).  
- Benefits: access to energy + creation of **credit histories**.  

### Microfinance 2.0
- Early breakthrough: Muhammad Yunus (1970s) → microloans without collateral.  
- Challenges: commercialization, limited impact of credit alone.  
- Broader needs: savings, insurance, pensions, payments.  
- Example: **IFMR Trust (India)** → expanded services after learning from cases like a client needing life insurance, not just loans.  
- Model: community workers with tablets + algorithms + trust relationships.  

### Trust-Based Institutions
- **Neighborhood Trust (NYC)**: evolved from a credit union to fintech for underserved.  
- Services: mobile banking, savings apps, socially responsible credit cards, payroll innovations.  
- Success factor: **trusted community figures** (e.g., “Marisol”) convincing people to adopt tools.  
- Lesson: innovation = **finance + technology + trust**.

## Part III – Public-Private Partnerships & Prevention
### Africa Risk Capacity (ARC)
- Insurance pool created by African Union (2015).  
- Covers drought risks, with satellite/weather data triggers.  
- Requires preparedness plans before entry.  
- Significance: **African-owned**, enhancing sovereignty & governance.  

### IFFIm – International Financing Facility for Immunizations
- Idea: securitize **future aid commitments** (20-year pledges).  
- Goldman Sachs + UK Treasury structured “vaccine bonds.”  
- ~$5B raised (2005–2015), funds directed to GAVI Alliance (vaccines = ~18% ROI).  
- Model now explored for refugee resettlement and maternal health.  

### Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) / Pay-for-Success
- Contracts between governments, nonprofits, and investors.  
- Mechanism:  
  - Investor funds preventive services → if successful, government repays.  
  - If not, taxpayer pays nothing; investor bears loss.  
- First cases:  
  - Peterborough (UK, 2010) → reduce recidivism.  
  - NYC (Rikers Island) → Bloomberg + Goldman Sachs.  
- Evolution: now applied to homelessness, substance abuse, early childhood education.  
- Importance:  
  - Evidence-based policy (RCTs).  
  - Depoliticized contracts (outlast administrations).  
  - Incremental scaling (e.g., D.C. Green SIB, ~$25–30M).

## Green Bonds
- Rapid growth: >$150B issued in 2017.  
- Issuers: corporates, municipalities, DFIs.  
- Challenge: **lack of standards** → risk of greenwashing.  
- Trade-off: stricter definitions = credibility but reduced liquidity/scale.

## Key Lessons
1. **Household-level innovation**: M-Pesa, M-Kopa, IFMR, Neighborhood Trust.  
2. **Prevention-focused PPPs**: ARC, IFFIm, SIBs.  
3. **Policy context matters**: supportive administrations accelerate adoption.  
4. **Investor incentives**: need balance between profit, social good, and nonprofit accountability.  
5. **Global leadership**: China emerging in climate finance, infrastructure, fintech.

## Conclusion
- Innovative finance is an **“all hands on deck”** activity.  
- Students and professionals trained in finance can apply tools beyond Wall Street.  
- Public-private partnerships and financial engineering can be reoriented toward **climate, health, inclusion, and justice**.  
- Yale networks and training can provide lifelong allies in pursuing finance for the common good.
