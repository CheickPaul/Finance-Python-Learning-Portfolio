# Lesson 10 – The Importance of Financial Theory

## Key Concepts
- Finance is more than speculation or short-term gains.
- 20th century: mathematical finance transformed resource allocation and information pooling.
- **Core Contributions:**
  - Resource allocation: distributes scarce resources efficiently.
  - Information pooling: markets aggregate diverse knowledge for better risk pricing.
  - Systemic benefits: even “unproductive” activities (e.g., options trading) enhance efficiency and stability.
- **Behavioral Finance:**
  - Adds psychology/social science dimensions.
  - Acts like “friction” in mechanics: makes models more realistic.
  - Enriches, not replaces, mathematical finance.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration:**
  - Law + economics: legal disputes ground abstract theory in reality.
  - Breaking silos: collaboration between finance, law, and management strengthens practice.
- **General Insights:**
  - Mathematical finance = backbone of markets.
  - Behavioral finance = realism and anomaly explanation.
  - Finance enables social benefits: feeding billions, education, innovation.
  - Legitimacy of finance relies on blending math, law, and psychology.

## My Notes
- Mathematical finance brought rigor, structure, and systemic impact.
- Behavioral finance prevents models from being purely theoretical, making them applicable.
- Law’s role is key: markets aren’t just numbers, they’re human agreements and enforceable contracts.
- The **future of finance lies in interdisciplinarity**.

## Reflection
**Mathematical vs Behavioral Finance**  
Mathematical models allow us to get closer to understanding markets, but we can never be 100% right.  
Coming from a background in discretionary trading, which is heavily rooted in behavioral finance, I am now learning quantitative tools to become more precise and performant.  
Quantitative methods, especially advanced statistics, enable the analysis of thousands of past scenarios and the generation of dynamic strategies that adapt to market conditions.  

**Ethics and Legitimacy**  
For me, legitimacy comes from a mix of three elements: mathematical models, law, and social trust.  
- Mathematical models improve efficiency and performance.  
- Law brings regulation and justice to the market.  
- Social trust ensures long-term stability and acceptance of financial systems.
