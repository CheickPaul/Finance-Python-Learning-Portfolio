# Lesson 12 – Exchanges

## Key Concepts
- **Origins**:  
  - First U.S. exchange: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), founded in 1792.  
  - Not the world’s first: Antwerp and Amsterdam preceded it.  
  - NYSE gained prestige as the U.S. "first mover."  

- **Nasdaq (1971)**:  
  - Created as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.  
  - First computerized market, replacing pink sheets (manual bid/ask listings for unlisted small-cap firms).  

- **Types of Markets**:  
  - **NYSE**: prestigious, strict listing requirements (earnings history, established reputation).  
  - **Pink Sheets**: pre-Internet, mailed quotes of non-listed, often disreputable companies.  
  - **Nasdaq Small Cap**: smaller, riskier firms.  
  - **Fourth Market**: direct trades between large institutions, bypassing exchanges.  

- **Prestige and Regulation**:  
  - Nasdaq overtook NYSE in dynamism, attracting innovative/adventurous firms.  
  - Congress created NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) to integrate fragmented markets.  
  - Companies can be delisted if confidence is lost or rules are violated.  

- **Information Technology & Exchanges**:  
  - 19th century growth aided by pulp paper, typewriters, filing cabinets, and carbon paper.  
  - These advances marked the Information Age of finance.  

- **Lending Exchanges (1926–1933)**:  
  - NYSE hosted a **loan crowd** for borrowing stocks used in short selling.  
  - After 1929 crash, short sellers were blamed → lending exchanges lost legitimacy.  

- **Listing Choice & Familiarity Bias**:  
  - Companies choose which exchange to list on.  
  - Research (Ning Zhu, Yale → Shanghai): investors prefer locally listed stocks due to familiarity bias.  
  - Bias is psychological, not informational, and is observed globally.  

## My Notes
- NYSE prestige was historically unmatched, but Nasdaq became dominant for innovative firms.  
- Familiarity bias strongly affects investor decisions, regardless of fundamentals.  
- The decline of lending exchanges shows how public opinion can reshape market structures.
