# Lesson 19 – Government Social Insurance

## Key Concepts
- **Historical Origins**:  
  - **Germany (Bismarck era, 1880s)**:  
    - 1883: Health insurance (*Krankenversicherung*).  
    - 1884: Accident insurance (*Unfallversicherung*).  
    - 1889: Disability & old-age insurance (*Invaliden- und Altersversicherung*).  
    - Initiated by economists (Schmoller, Brentano, Wagner), not Bismarck himself.  
  - **United Kingdom (1911, Lloyd George)**:  
    - Introduction of unemployment insurance.  
    - Inspired by German worker’s compensation model.  

- **Why Government Intervention?**  
  - Private sector cannot manage all risks.  
  - Public mistrust of private insurers.  
  - Goal: internalize social costs and prevent visible misery.  
    - Example: Germany (no cripples begging) vs London (pre-worker’s comp).  

- **Major U.S. Programs**:  
  - **AFDC (1935–1996)** → abolished due to moral hazard, replaced by **SNAP** (food stamps).  
  - **Progressive taxes** → risk management via Earned Income Tax Credit.  
  - **Public education** → transfers wealth to low-income households.  
  - **Social Security (OASDI, 1939)** → old age, survivors, disability. Renamed *Survivors Insurance* to avoid conflict with private insurers.  
  - **Worker’s Compensation** → mandatory employer-paid insurance.  
  - **Government health insurance** → Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare.  

- **Tax Innovations**:  
  - Civil War income tax failed (fraud, weak documentation).  
  - Withholding tax introduced to ensure compliance.  
  - Declining corruption improved enforcement.  

- **General Logic**:  
  - Public social insurance replaced religious charity.  
  - Core principles:  
    - Reduce individual risk.  
    - Share risks collectively.  
    - Incentivize safer/productive behaviors.  
  - Slow progress but trend toward protecting the vulnerable, limiting moral hazard, and building trust.

## My Notes
- Social insurance emerged as a response to failures of charity and private insurance.  
- Strong behavioral component: design must reduce risk without encouraging dependency.  
- Withholding tax was a major innovation → ensures compliance and steady government revenue.  
- U.S. programs (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) illustrate gradual but consistent expansion of government’s role.  
- Global convergence: most developed economies mix private and public systems.
