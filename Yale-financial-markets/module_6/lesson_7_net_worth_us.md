# Lesson 7 – Net Worth of the United States

## Key Concepts
- **Professional Money Managers**:  
  - Distinct from investment and commercial bankers.  
  - Their role is managing other people’s money by investing directly in markets (stocks, bonds, etc.).  
  - Comparable to commercial banks but with direct financial market focus.  

- **Total Assets of U.S. Households**:  
  - $101 trillion (Federal Reserve, Table B-101).  
  - ≈ $270,000 per person.  
  - ≈ $1 million for a typical family of four.  
  - Note: large inequality → median much lower, bottom 10% ≈ zero.  

- **Composition of Assets**:  
  - Real estate: ≈ $25T (≈ 25%).  
  - Pension funds: ≈ $20T.  
  - Equity in non-corporate business: ≈ $10T.  
  - Directly owned stocks: ≈ $13T.  
  - Bank deposits: ≈ $10T.  
  - Mutual funds: ≈ $8T.  
  - Consumer durables: ≈ $5T.  
  - Government bonds (direct holdings): very small.  
  - Corporate bonds (direct holdings): ≈ $296B.  
  - Municipal bonds: more common among wealthy (tax advantages).  
  - Life insurance (cash value): ≈ $1T.  

- **Liabilities**:  
  - Mortgages: ≈ $10T.  
  - Consumer credit: ≈ $3.5T.  
  - Other bank loans: ≈ $1.5T.  
  - Total liabilities: ≈ $14.5T.  

- **Net Worth**:  
  - Assets ($101T) – Liabilities ($14.5T) = ≈ $86T.  
  - The “$1M per household” figure is misleading: it doesn’t adjust for debt.  

## My Notes
- U.S. household balance sheets are dominated by **three pillars**: housing, pensions, and financial assets.  
- Direct ownership of bonds is limited — institutions hold the bulk.  
- Debt is significant, particularly mortgages, which offset a large part of gross assets.  
- Inequality is stark: averages hide that many households have near-zero net worth.  

## Reflection
The U.S. household model shows that most of the average net worth comes from three pillars: real estate, pension funds, and financial investments. This inspires a similar approach for long-term wealth building as a salaried worker.  

**Phase 1 – The 3 Pillars**  
- **Emergency Fund** → build security first, covering 6 months of expenses.  
- **Money Managers / ETFs** → contribute regularly (e.g. €500/month) into diversified funds, reproducing the U.S. logic of pension and mutual fund accumulation.  
- **Real Estate** → secure a primary residence and possibly one rental property, echoing the fact that ~25% of U.S. household assets are in housing.  

This structure mirrors the American balance sheet:  
- Homes + pensions = backbone of net worth,  
- Financial investments = compounding growth,  
- Liquidity reserves = resilience against shocks.  

Tax deferral is key: compounding works best when you minimize interim taxation.  

- ETFs (accumulating) and business ownership (retained earnings) allow for tax deferral.  
- Real estate is less flexible, since rent is taxed annually, but it remains a powerful inflation hedge and leverage tool.
