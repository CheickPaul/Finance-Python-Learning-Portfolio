# Lesson 5 – Rating Agencies

## Key Concepts
- **Definition and Role**:  
  - Alternative to trusting investment bankers: agencies publish information openly rather than keeping it secret.  
  - Purpose: evaluate integrity and creditworthiness of companies and securities.  

- **Historical Origins**:  
  - 1860: Henry Varnum Poor publishes *History of Railways and Canals in the US*.  
  - 1909: John L. Moody founds Moody’s Investor Services.  
  - 1916: Poor’s merges with Standard Statistics → Standard & Poor’s (S&P).  

- **The Rating System**:  
  - Inspired by university grading (A, B, C, D).  
  - Best rating = AAA (Triple-A).  
  - Categories:  
    - **Investment Grade**: AAA, AA, A, BBB.  
    - **Speculative Grade (Junk Bonds)**: BB, B, CCC, CC, C.  
    - **Default**: D.  

- **Moody’s Mission (1933)**:  
  - Motivated by desire for truth and transparency.  
  - Published critiques to expose corporate misconduct.  
  - Moody’s manuals became widely used by investors.  

- **Conflict of Interest Problem**:  
  - Original principle: agencies did not accept money from issuers.  
  - Since the 1970s: agencies began charging issuers directly.  
  - Became highly profitable, especially with structured products.  

- **The 2000s Crisis Example** (*The Big Short*):  
  - Agencies gave inflated ratings without verifying underlying risks.  
  - Competitive pressure: “If we don’t rate, competitors will.”  
  - Contributed to the housing and financial crisis.  

- **Reforms and Today’s Practices**:  
  - Post-crisis: stricter regulations, need to restore reputation.  
  - Agencies still charge issuers, but apply more rigorous standards.  
  - Remain central to global finance (corporate bonds, sovereign debt, structured finance).  
  - Debt concepts:  
    - **Debt** = total stock owed.  
    - **Debt-to-GDP** = debt compared to economic output.  
    - **Deficit/Surplus** = yearly flow increasing or decreasing debt.  

## My Notes
- Rating agencies became essential for global markets, especially in bond issuance.  
- Their credibility depends on independence, yet conflicts of interest emerged once they began charging issuers.  
- Their failures in the 2000s show how competition and profit motives can undermine objectivity.  
- Despite reforms, ratings remain a central pillar for sovereign and corporate financing.  

## Reflection
France: Public debt reached about 113% of GDP in 2024, with a fiscal deficit of –5.8% of GDP the same year. Growth remains modest, and Fitch downgraded the sovereign rating to A+ in September 2025, highlighting concerns over fiscal sustainability.  

Denmark: Public debt stood at only 31% of GDP in 2024, while the government posted a +4.5% budget surplus. Strong fiscal discipline and long-term pension reforms underpin its AAA rating and high financial credibility.
