# Lesson 1 – Investment Banks Introduction

## Key Concepts
- Investment banks are financial intermediaries that manage investments for individuals and institutions.  
- Unlike commercial banks, they do not take deposits but specialize in capital markets.  
- Services include advisory, underwriting, trading, and asset management.  
- Historically, investing was an individual activity; now intermediaries dominate (banks, mutual funds, ETFs, money managers).  
- Types of intermediaries:  
  - Mutual fund managers → pool money for diversified portfolios.  
  - ETF managers → provide exchange-traded funds replicating indexes or strategies.  
  - Pension funds & institutional investors → manage retirement and large-scale assets.  
- Distinction:  
  - Commercial banks → deposits, loans, local operations.  
  - Investment banks → global, focus on capital raising, securities issuance, and trading.  
- Reputation and credibility are essential for their function.  
- Key insight: investment banks and money managers act as gateways between investors and markets, reducing barriers, providing trust and efficiency, and enabling large-scale capital allocation.

## My Notes
- Investment banks are less about “retail clients” and more about **capital allocation at scale**.  
- Their credibility is their main “asset”: without reputation, their deals lose value.  
- The shift from individual investing to institutionalized investing shows how markets became more **efficient but also more concentrated**.  
- ETFs and mutual funds democratize access but also concentrate decision-making in few hands.  

## Reflection
Investment banks act as the **infrastructure of modern finance**.  
They do not just raise money; they legitimize markets by providing trust and credibility.  
The contrast with commercial banks shows how finance has specialized: one side focused on community credit, the other on global markets.
