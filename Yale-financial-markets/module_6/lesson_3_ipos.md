# Lesson 3 – IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)

## Key Concepts
- **Definition**: IPO = first public sale of a company’s shares.  
  - Before IPO, shares can be privately placed (illiquid, rarely traded).  
  - Example: Case-Schiller Weiss Inc. (private, never listed).  
- **Regulation and SEC’s Role**:  
  - SEC regulates IPOs to prevent manipulation/distortion.  
  - It does not judge business potential (e.g., Facebook).  
- **Underpricing Phenomenon**:  
  - IPOs often deliberately underpriced.  
  - Typical effect: aftermarket jump (e.g., $25 → $30).  
  - Rationale: create demand, ensure sale success, build reputation.  
  - Underwriters defend: “This is how it works, otherwise you would get less.”  
- **Access to IPOs**:  
  - Hard for small investors to participate.  
  - Allocation favors preferred/stable clients.  
  - Goal: avoid “flippers” (young investors selling immediately).  
- **Long-Term Performance (Jay Ritter, 1991)**:  
  - Avg. +16% on first day.  
  - Long-run: underperformance after a few years.  
  - Brokers prefer “stable” investors (older, less active).  
- **Manipulation and Ethics**:  
  - IPOs involve a form of manipulation but widely accepted.  
  - Seen as part of market framing/strategy.  
  - Ethics matter, but underpricing = normal practice.  
- **Impresario Hypothesis**:  
  - Analogy with concert managers keeping ticket prices low to create buzz.  
  - Goal: long lines, hype, media attention.  
  - Too high prices = empty venues.  
  - Conclusion: underpricing = marketing tool for long-term demand.  

## My Notes
- IPOs are often **underpriced** as a deliberate strategy to build demand and reputation.  
- Access is skewed toward **institutional investors**, with retail largely excluded.  
- Short-term gains are common (+16% first day), but long-term performance tends to decline.  
- The impresario analogy highlights that underpricing is less about valuation and more about **marketing psychology**.  

## Reflection
I do not consider IPOs as manipulation: since the SEC allows underpricing, it should be seen as a market rule.  
In fact, I interpret it as a marketing principle, similar to discounting a product at launch to create momentum.  

For me, the exclusion of retail investors is clearly an entry barrier. It reflects how access in financial markets is often stratified, favoring institutional clients.  

From an investment perspective, I believe both horizons are relevant: short term for the initial pop, and long term for fundamentals. However, as a short-term trader, I would personally prioritize the first-day performance.  

Regarding the impresario analogy, just like a concert manager keeps ticket prices low to fill the hall and generate hype, underwriters underprice IPOs to create buzz and long-term reputation. This shows that finance is not only about valuation, but also about perception and psychology.  

If I were on an Equity Capital Markets desk, I would feel enthusiastic about orchestrating IPOs, even knowing about their “game-like” mechanisms.
