# Lesson 6 – Glass–Steagall Timeline (Simplified)

## Key Concepts
- **1929 Crash**:  
  - Stock market collapses.  
  - Blame: banks mixed commercial banking (deposits, loans) with investment banking (speculation, securities).  

- **1933 – Glass–Steagall Act**:  
  - Separates commercial banks from investment banks.  
  - Creates FDIC (deposit insurance).  
  - Example: JP Morgan remains commercial → partners create Morgan Stanley (1935) as an investment bank.  

- **1933–1990s – Separation Era**:  
  - U.S. banks operate under strict separation.  
  - Europe & Canada allow universal banking.  
  - Over time, U.S. banks complain they are less competitive.  

- **1999 – Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act**:  
  - Signed by President Clinton.  
  - Repeals Glass–Steagall → banks can combine commercial, investment, and insurance.  
  - Triggers mega-mergers: Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, UBS, Credit Suisse.  

- **2007–2008 Financial Crisis**:  
  - Critics argue repeal of Glass–Steagall encouraged excessive risk-taking.  

- **2010 – Dodd–Frank Act**:  
  - Reform after the crisis.  
  - Did not restore Glass–Steagall.  
  - Introduces **Volcker Rule**:  
    - Banks can underwrite securities.  
    - But cannot engage in proprietary trading with their own capital.  

**Summary:**  
- 1933–1999 = Separation (Glass–Steagall).  
- 1999 = Repeal (Gramm–Leach–Bliley).  
- 2010 = Volcker Rule (partial restriction after the crisis).  

## My Notes
- Glass–Steagall reflects the U.S. attempt to insulate deposit-taking banks from speculative risks.  
- Its repeal reflects globalization pressures: U.S. banks wanted to compete with universal banks abroad.  
- The Volcker Rule is a partial restoration, targeting proprietary trading as the riskiest activity.  

## Reflection
Where to Go if You Want to Trade  

When considering a career in trading, it is important to distinguish between different types of institutions:  

**Investment Banks (Securities Divisions):**  
Provide strong training and global prestige (e.g., GS, MS, JPM, Citi, BofA).  
Offer access to sales & trading desks.  
Advisory roles (bond issuance, DCM) are distinct and less trading-focused.  

**Prop Trading Firms / Market Makers (Jane Street, Optiver, IMC, SIG, Citadel Securities):**  
Specialize in proprietary trading with their own capital.  
Highly meritocratic, with strong emphasis on math and coding skills.  
Potentially higher compensation compared to banks, but very competitive.  

**Hedge Funds (Citadel, Millennium, Point72, DE Shaw):**  
Focus on advanced and specialized strategies (macro, quant, fixed income, credit).  
Typically recruit professionals with prior trading experience.  

**Universal Banks in Denmark/Europe (Danske Bank Markets, Nordea Markets, BNP Paribas, Barclays):**  
Easier entry point in the Nordic region.  
Strong in covered bonds and Nordic rates.  

**Conclusion:**  
The choice of institution shapes the type of trading exposure:  
- Investment banks provide structured training and prestige.  
- Prop firms offer pure performance-driven trading.  
- Hedge funds demand specialization.  
- Universal banks in Europe provide accessible entry routes into fixed income trading.
