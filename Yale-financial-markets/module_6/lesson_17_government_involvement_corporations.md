# Lesson 17 – Government Involvement in Corporations

## Key Concepts
- Capitalism assumes separation between **government** and **private corporations**, but in practice, governments intervene.  
- **Forms of involvement**:  
  1. Regulation (safety, environment, financial rules).  
  2. Ownership (rare in the U.S., common in China).  
  3. Nationalization threat (always implicit, even in capitalist systems).  
- **Case Study – TEPCO (Fukushima, Japan, 2011)**:  
  - Nuclear disaster created massive damages.  
  - Government stepped in → owned 50% by 2012, total control of **88.69%** after converting debt into preferred shares.  
  - Shareholders were diluted, stock collapsed.  
- **Bankruptcy as state involvement**:  
  - **Chapter 7 (U.S.)**: liquidation → assets sold, shareholders wiped out.  
  - **Chapter 11 (U.S.)**: reorganization → firm continues if enterprise value exists.  
    - Example: General Motors bailout, government absorbed part of the losses.  
- **Parallel with personal bankruptcy**:  
  - Bankruptcy allows risk-taking, with losses partially socialized.  
  - Government absorbs part of the risk (unless criminal).  
- **Conclusion**:  
  - Government often becomes a de facto shareholder.  
  - Acts as **“Risk Manager of Last Resort.”**

## My Notes
- Governments intervene when systemic risk is too high (finance, utilities, strategic industries).  
- Limited liability protects individuals and firms, but large failures spill over to the state.  
- Examples: 2008 bailouts (AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac); Fukushima (TEPCO).  
- Nationalization is not always ideological → often pragmatic, to stabilize the system.  
- Shareholders can lose everything when governments step in.

## Reflection
Even in countries like the United States, which are considered very capitalist, there is always a hidden risk of nationalization. When a company becomes too important for the economy or for society, the government cannot simply let it fail. If the collapse of a bank threatens the entire financial system, or if a utility company creates damage that it cannot pay for, the state is forced to intervene.  

This intervention can take many forms: bailouts, partial ownership, or full nationalization. In 2008, the U.S. government became the owner of companies such as AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to protect the financial system. In Japan, after the Fukushima disaster, the government took control of TEPCO because the damages were far too large for the company alone.  

For investors, this means that their shares are never completely safe. Limited liability protects them personally, but when losses are too big, the government steps in and shareholders are diluted or wiped out. The state becomes the “risk manager of last resort.” That is why the threat of nationalization is always present, even if it is not visible in normal times.
