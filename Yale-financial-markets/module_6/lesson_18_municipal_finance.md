# Lesson 18 – Municipal Finance

## Key Concepts
- In the U.S., **state governments** are sovereign (similar to EU countries).  
- The **federal government cannot declare states bankrupt**, but it can allow municipal bankruptcies under *Chapter 9*.  
- **Why cities borrow**:  
  - New cities need infrastructure (roads, sewers, schools).  
  - If only current residents pay, taxes would be unbearable.  
  - Borrowing spreads costs across future residents → a **bet on growth**.  
- **Balanced Budget Rules for States**:  
  - Most states prohibit deficits on operating budgets.  
  - Example: Connecticut introduced an income tax + balanced budget amendment.  
  - Distinction:  
    - **Current account** (operating, salaries, annual expenses) → no deficits allowed.  
    - **Capital account** (long-term investment) → borrowing allowed.  
- **Types of Local Debt**:  
  - **General Obligation Bonds** → repaid through future tax revenues.  
  - **Revenue Bonds** → tied to specific projects (e.g., toll road). Repaid by project revenues.  
- **Municipal Bankruptcy**:  
  - Only for municipalities under **Chapter 9**.  
  - Enables restructuring of local debt in crises.

## My Notes
- States ≈ sovereign entities, but municipalities are subject to federal law.  
- Borrowing allows intergenerational sharing of infrastructure costs.  
- Balanced budgets prevent states from accumulating structural deficits, but capital projects still rely on debt issuance.  
- General obligation bonds = backed by taxing power; revenue bonds = entrepreneurial, linked to project outcomes.  
- Chapter 9 provides flexibility for cities in fiscal crisis, but no equivalent exists for U.S. states.
