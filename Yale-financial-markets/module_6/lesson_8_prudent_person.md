# Lesson 8 – The Prudent Person Rule

## Key Concepts
- **Origins**:  
  - 1974 – ERISA (Employment Retirement Income Security Act): required investment managers to act as a “prudent man/person,” with care, skill, prudence, and diligence.  
  - Goal: ensure managers behave as a competent and responsible person would under similar circumstances.  

- **Evolution of Regulation**:  
  - Problem: the rule was vague – how do you define “prudence”?  
  - Dodd–Frank Act (2010): dropped the term “prudent person” and replaced it with prudential standards (appearing 34 times).  
  - Trend: shift from broad principles to explicit regulatory standards.  

- **Categories of Financial Professionals**:  
  - **Financial advisor**: advises on securities and investments → subject to regulation.  
  - **Exclusions**: bankers, lawyers, journalists, professors, broker-dealers.  
  - **Broker-dealer**: executes buy/sell orders. May give informal advice, but remains excluded from the “advisor” category.  
  - **Financial planner**: offers comprehensive life planning (retirement, estate, etc.). Not directly regulated, but private certifications exist (e.g., CFP).  

- **Registration Requirements (1996 Act)**:  
  - ≥ $30M AUM → must register with the SEC.  
  - < $25M AUM → must register with state regulators.  
  - $25M–$30M AUM: discretionary choice of SEC or state.  
  - Ban: convicted felons cannot act as advisors.  

## My Notes
- The “prudent person” concept was too subjective, leading to inconsistent applications.  
- Regulation evolved toward **clearer, rule-based standards**.  
- Professional categories are increasingly complex, with blurred lines between advisor, broker, and planner.  
- Financial planners remain largely outside strict regulation, relying instead on private certifications.
