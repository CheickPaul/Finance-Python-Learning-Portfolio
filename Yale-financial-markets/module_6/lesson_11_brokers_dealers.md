# Lesson 11 – Brokers and Dealers

## Key Concepts
- **Broker (Agent)**:  
  - Acts on behalf of others as an agent.  
  - Earns a commission by matching buyers and sellers.  
  - Example: stockbroker finds a seller for a buyer and charges a commission.  

- **Dealer (Principal)**:  
  - Acts for own account, not as agent.  
  - Buys and sells securities from own inventory.  
  - Makes money from markup (bid–ask spread), not commission.  
  - Example: dealer buys at a lower price and sells at a higher price.  

- **Bid–Ask Spread**:  
  - Difference between buying (bid) and selling (ask) prices.  
  - Represents cost of trading in dealer markets.  

- **Broker–Dealer**:  
  - A firm that can act as both broker and dealer (but not in the same transaction).  
  - Dealers often required by exchanges to execute a minimum quantity at posted prices.  

- **Inter–Dealer Broker**:  
  - A broker that facilitates transactions between dealers.  

## My Notes
- **Analogies**:  
  - Antique dealer: buys antiques, sets selling price (wide spreads, higher costs).  
  - Dealer market: competition among dealers narrows spreads, reducing trading costs.  
  - Real estate: mostly brokers; few dealers due to tax treatment.  
  - Exception: Germany has “Immobilienmakler” (dealer-like actors).  

- **Good vs. Bad Broker Behavior**:  
  - Good: represent client interests, fair commission structures.  
  - Bad (Churning): excessive trading in a client’s account to generate commissions.  
    - Example: Robert Magnan (1999), turnover rate of 11 (entire portfolio traded monthly).  
    - Clients needed ~50% returns just to cover costs.  
    - SEC views this as illegal/unethical, punishable by lifetime ban.  

**Key Lesson:** Churning is illegal and violates SEC rules. To avoid, investors should keep control of their trading accounts and not give full discretion to brokers.
