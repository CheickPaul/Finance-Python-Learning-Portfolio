# Lesson 4 – Goldman Sachs and John Whitehead

## Key Concepts
- **Charles Ellis & The Partnership**:  
  - Charles Ellis, Yale Corporation member, wrote *The Partnership* just before the financial crisis.  
  - Focused on Goldman Sachs, then the most esteemed and successful U.S. investment bank.  
  - Tone: mostly admiring, sometimes critical.  

- **The Original Goldman Sachs Culture**:  
  - Primary objective: making money — no exceptions.  
  - Prestige supported business but was never an end goal.  
  - Prestigious clients often charged the most.  
  - Core values:  
    - Absolute loyalty to the partnership.  
    - Personal anonymity: employees represent Goldman Sachs, not themselves.  
    - Operated like a family, similar to traditions in Chinese, Arab, and old European contexts.  

- **John Whitehead’s Principles (1970s)**:  
  - Client-first priority: “Money for the client before the firm.”  
  - Core assets: people, capital, reputation.  
  - Banking built on trust and reputation.  
  - Emphasis on excellence, creativity, imagination.  
  - “Talk to the boss” culture: juniors expected to speak directly to CEOs.  
  - Respect for individuals and client satisfaction as non-negotiable.  

- **Later Decline**:  
  - Goldman drifted away from “client first.”  
  - Example: $5 billion settlement for dishonest mortgage security marketing.  
  - Loss of partnership reduced family-like culture.  
  - Still home to many talented and ethical individuals.  

## My Notes
- Goldman’s early motto “money first” built profits but created risks for client trust.  
- Whitehead’s client-first principle emphasized reputation, people, and long-term relationships.  
- The “talk to the boss” culture empowered juniors and prefigured modern open organizations.  
- The decline of the partnership structure shows how corporate form can shape firm culture.  

## Reflection
Goldman’s culture (money first) :  

I believe “money first” can damage client trust. Clients prefer a win–win strategy, not just profit for the firm.  

Personally, I would not feel comfortable in such a culture. A company focused solely on money spends too much time and money managing frustrated clients, and becomes weak if new competition arises.  

Client-first principle :  

I agree with Whitehead’s client-first approach.  

To me, trading is a fair game: the more participants, the higher the chances of success for the best players.  

Talking to the boss :  

I see Whitehead’s rule as empowering and bold.  

He was right, because in 2025 most well-established and successful companies apply this principle — aiming for direct access to decision-makers.  

Trust and reputation :  

I think reputation is as important as revenue.  

Reputation attracts talent: people want to join and stay in a company with strong values.  

Personal takeaway  

The border between proprietary trading and agency trading is very thin.  

Reasons:  
- They often share the same infrastructure (desks, systems, analysts, data).  
- Proprietary trading is sometimes financed through leverage or funding linked to clients, making the capital indirectly connected.  
- There are frequent conflicts of interest, since a bank can act both as a counterparty and as a client’s service provider.  

Even proprietary trading firms should therefore adopt a client-first policy, because:  
- It builds trust, reputation, and long-term relationships.  
- Losses or misconduct in prop trading inevitably affect client perception and confidence.  

Profitability and ethics are not contradictory — prioritizing clients can ultimately attract more business and more capital.
