# Lesson 16 – Government Debt

## Key Concepts
- **Public Finance**: governments face lenders just like corporations, borrowing from investors. 
- **Default**: failure to pay debt obligations (does not mean investors lose everything). usually partial and followed by restructuring.
- **Repudiation**: outright refusal to ever pay the debt (e.g., Communist Russia and China).  
- **Odious Debt**: debt declared illegitimate because it was contracted by a corrupt regime.  
- **Why governments rarely repudiate**:  
  - It can only be done once → credibility loss.  
  - Future borrowing requires trust.  
  - National reputation is at stake.  
- **Special features of sovereign default**:  
  - No international bankruptcy court.  
  - Collective Action Clauses (CACs) now make restructurings easier.  
- **Historical perspective**: defaults are frequent in history and tend to come in waves (Reinhart & Rogoff).

## My Notes
- Sovereign debt attracts investors with higher yields in risky cases (e.g., Greece, Argentina), but carries high uncertainty.  
- Default is often partial (restructuring, haircut) rather than total loss.  
- Repudiation is rare and tied to political revolutions.  
- Credit rating agencies play a key role in signaling creditworthiness (AAA vs junk).  
- Sovereign credibility relies on reputation and fiscal discipline, not just legal frameworks.

## Reflection
The distinction between default and repudiation is fundamental:  
- **Default**: usually partial, with negotiations and restructurings.  
- **Repudiation**: rare and radical, when a government declares debt illegitimate and refuses repayment entirely.  

**Historical cases**:  
- **Russia (1917)**: Bolshevik repudiation of Tsarist debt cut the USSR from global markets for decades.  
- **China (1949)**: Communist government refused to honor Nationalist debt, leading to long isolation until the 1980s.  

**Modern perspective**:  
- **Denmark (2025)**: government bonds are rated **AAA**, backed by fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP (~31%).  
  - A unique feature is the Danish **covered bond market (realkreditobligationer)**, deeply tied to housing.  
  - These mortgage-backed bonds are among the safest in the world, thanks to collateral, regulation, and centuries of proven stability.  
  - Together, sovereign bonds and covered bonds create one of the most resilient fixed-income ecosystems globally.  
- **United States**: U.S. Treasuries long considered “risk-free,” but the 2008 mortgage crisis destabilized trust in U.S. debt markets. In **2011**, S&P downgraded U.S. debt from AAA to AA+, proving even the safest sovereign assets are not immune to systemic shocks.  

**Takeaway**:  
Denmark shows how fiscal prudence and a robust housing-backed bond system can reinforce credibility. The U.S. case, however, is a reminder that **no asset is absolutely risk-free**. Even AAA bonds carry systemic risk, requiring investors to remain cautious and diversify.
