# Lesson 10 – Mutual Funds, Closed-End Funds, and ETFs

## Key Concepts
- **Mutual Funds (Open-End)**:  
  - Investors give money directly to the fund (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard).  
  - **Buying/Selling**: once per day, at the closing price (4:00 pm).  
  - **Redemption**: directly from the fund, at NAV (Net Asset Value).  
  - **Fees**: generally higher (manager salaries, marketing, etc.).  
  - **Price vs NAV**: always equal to the real value of the assets.  
  - Example: invest €10,000 in a U.S. equity mutual fund → value updated daily at 4:00 pm.  

- **Closed-End Funds**:  
  - Fund does an IPO and sells a fixed number of shares.  
  - **Buying/Selling**: happens on stock exchange throughout the day.  
  - **Redemption**: cannot redeem directly; must sell shares to another investor.  
  - **Fees**: variable.  
  - **Price vs NAV**: can trade at a discount or premium.  
  - Example: assets worth €100 per share might trade at €90 (discount) or €110 (premium).  

- **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**:  
  - Similar to mutual funds but traded on exchanges like stocks.  
  - **Buying/Selling**: possible throughout the day.  
  - **Redemption**: retail investors sell shares on the market; authorized participants (APs) arbitrage price vs NAV.  
    - If ETF price > NAV → create shares → price decreases.  
    - If ETF price < NAV → buy/cancel shares → price increases.  
  - **Fees**: very low (often <0.20%/year).  
  - **Price vs NAV**: stays close to NAV thanks to arbitrage.  
  - Example: SPDR S&P 500 ETF → trades close to index value throughout the day.  

## My Notes
- Mutual funds offer simplicity and daily liquidity, but higher fees and only 1 trade/day.  
- Closed-end funds provide continuous trading but risk disconnection from NAV.  
- ETFs combine flexibility with low fees, and arbitrage mechanisms keep prices aligned with NAV.  
- ETFs have become the dominant vehicle for retail and institutional investors due to cost efficiency and transparency.
