  - **Basel I (1988)**: first regulatory framework.  
  - **Basel II (2004)**: more risk sensitivity.  
  - **Basel III (2009, adopted 2010 after the crisis)**: stronger capital and liquidity rules.  
- The Committee has **no formal authority**, but its recommendations are widely adopted.

## 6. Historical Lesson: Regulation is Essential
- **US Great Depression response (Roosevelt era)**: regulate capitalism (e.g., creation of the SEC).
