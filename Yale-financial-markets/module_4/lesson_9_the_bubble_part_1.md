# Lesson – The Bubble, Part 1: Early Signs of Irrational Exuberance

## 1. Context: Speculative Price Movements
- Bubbles are characterized by **rapid price increases disconnected from fundamentals**.  
- In housing, as in stocks, people begin to believe that past increases will continue indefinitely.  
- Robert Shiller highlights that investors often **ignore historical evidence** and instead rely on **short-term memory**.

## 2. The Psychology of Bubbles
- Bubbles are driven by **social contagion**: people copy the behavior of others.  
- Narratives spread quickly:  
  - “Housing is the safest investment.”  
  - “Prices never fall nationwide.”  
- Media coverage reinforces this optimism by celebrating rising prices and success stories.

## 3. Historical Patterns
- U.S. history shows several housing booms before the 2000s.  
- Patterns repeat:  
  - Prices increase sharply.  
  - Optimism spreads.  
  - Corrections follow, often severe.  
- Yet, each new cycle tends to **ignore previous crashes**.

## 4. Misperceptions of Risk
- Investors **underestimate the possibility of price declines**.  
- After years of rising prices, people assume risk is minimal.  
- This drives:  
  - **Over-leverage**  
  - **Excessive borrowing**  
  - **Unsustainable speculation**

## 5. Early Warnings Before the 2000s Bubble
- By the late 1990s and early 2000s, housing prices had already shown **unusual growth** compared to historical norms.  
- Long-term ratios like **price-to-income** and **price-to-rent** were diverging from averages.  
- Few analysts or institutions highlighted these risks, reinforcing bubble dynamics.

## 6. The Role of Data and Information
- A key issue: the **absence of widely available long-term housing price data**.  
- Most people only saw short-term trends (5–10 years).  
- Without historical perspective, they assumed growth was **structural and permanent**.

## 7. Protecting Against Bubble Misperceptions

### Historical Context
- Always compare valuations with **long-term averages**.  
- Use at least **50–100 years of data** when available.  

### Skepticism Toward Narratives
- Question “new era” claims that fundamentals no longer matter.  
- Avoid **herd mentality** and **media-driven optimism**.  

### Risk Management
- Limit leverage during rapid price expansions.  
- Diversify across assets to reduce exposure to a single overheated market.
