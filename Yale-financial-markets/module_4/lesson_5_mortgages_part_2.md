# Lesson – Mortgages, Part 2 (Yale University – Coursera)

## 1. Mortgage Rates and Treasury Yields

* **30-year mortgage rates** track **10-year U.S. Treasury yields**.  
  - Reason: avg. life of a mortgage ≈ 10 years (due to refinancing, selling).  
* Spread vs Treasuries = compensation for:  
  - **Credit risk** (defaults).  
  - **Servicing costs** (collections, paperwork).  
  - **Mortgage insurance** (e.g., FHA, 0.5–1.5%).

## 2. Historical Peaks – 1980s Inflation

* **1982**: Mortgage rates peaked at ~**19%**.  
  - Example: $300k house → $60k/year mortgage cost (~20%).  
* Result: **affordability crisis** → home prices collapsed.  
* Inflation offset part of burden, but **cash payments were unsustainable**.

## 3. Alternative Mortgage Designs

* **PLAM (Price Level Adjusted Mortgage)**  
  - Payments adjust for inflation.  
  - Sometimes with **negative amortization** (principal rises initially).  
  - Rare today.  

* **ARMs (Adjustable-Rate Mortgages)**  
  - Rate tied to benchmark (e.g., 1-year Treasury + spread).  
  - Payments fluctuate with market interest rates.  

* **SAMs (Shared Appreciation Mortgages)**  
  - Borrower gives lender a share of appreciation instead of (or plus) interest.  
  - Popular in UK 1990s–2000s.  
  - Declined when housing boomed.  

* **Home Equity Loans / Second Mortgages**  
  - Borrowing against home for consumption (renovations, vacations).  
  - Expanded pre-2008 → **overleveraged households**.

## 4. Inflation and Housing Markets

* Late 1970s–early 1980s: double-digit inflation (12%+).  
* Fed (Volcker) raised rates aggressively.  
* Result: **mortgage rates >18%**, housing affordability collapsed.  
* Without inflation-adjusted mortgages (PLAMs), buyers suffered.  
* Prices recovered once **inflation + rates declined**.
