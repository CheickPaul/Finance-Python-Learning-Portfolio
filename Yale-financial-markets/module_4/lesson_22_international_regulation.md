# [International Regulation]

## Key Concepts
- Financial markets are global, but regulation is mostly **national** → creates gaps and inconsistencies.  
- Need for **international coordination** to avoid regulatory arbitrage.  
- Key bodies:  
  - **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** – “central bank of central banks.”  
  - **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision** – sets capital adequacy standards.  
  - **IOSCO** (International Organization of Securities Commissions).  
  - **IMF & World Bank** – influence via lending and technical assistance.  
- Basel Accords:  
  - Basel I (1988): minimum capital requirements.  
  - Basel II (2004): risk-sensitive framework.  
  - Basel III (2010): stricter capital, liquidity, leverage rules (post-2008).  
- Challenge: enforcement depends on **national governments** → uneven adoption.

## My Notes
- Cross-border finance means crises spread quickly → international regulation is critical.  
- Basel standards are not laws → countries choose how strictly to implement.  
- Weak implementation (or delays) can create loopholes → “race to the bottom.”  
- IMF conditionality: countries in crisis must adopt reforms to access funding.  
- Post-2008: greater push for harmonization, but still uneven (e.g., U.S. stricter than EU in some areas).  
- Tension: global standards vs national sovereignty.
