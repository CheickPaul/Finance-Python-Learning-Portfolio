# [National Regulation, Part 3]

## Key Concepts
- National regulation tries to balance **market freedom** with **systemic stability**.  
- Heavy regulation can reduce innovation and competitiveness.  
- Too little regulation exposes markets to crises, contagion, and loss of trust.  
- Example: Basel frameworks (Basel I, II, III) → harmonized international capital standards.  
- Regulatory capture is a risk: when agencies serve the interests of the industry they regulate.  
- Debate: rules-based regulation (clear, strict rules) vs principles-based regulation (flexible, broad guidance).

## My Notes
- Financial history shows a cycle: **innovation → boom → crisis → regulation**.  
- Regulation must evolve with technology: fintech, digital assets, crypto exchanges.  
- The Basel accords are central but implementation differs by country → uneven playing field.  
- Regulatory capture makes regulation less effective (lobbying, industry revolving doors).  
- Principles-based regulation allows flexibility but can be vague → depends on enforcement culture.
