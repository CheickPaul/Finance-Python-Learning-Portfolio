# Lesson – Regulation Overview

## 1. Context: Crises, Misbehavior, and Regulation
- Financial regulation addresses **human problems, manipulation, and deception**.  
- In *Phishing for Phools* (Shiller & Akerlof), “phishing” = exploiting psychological biases.  
- Example: **$9.99 vs $10** pricing.  
  - Consumers perceive $9.99 as cheaper because they focus on the first digit.  
  - Firms adopt such tricks not always by choice, but due to **competitive pressure**.  
- If one company avoids it, competitors still do it → risk of losing customers.  
- This leads to a **Phishing Equilibrium**: manipulation becomes the industry norm.

## 2. The Phishing Equilibrium
- In competitive markets, companies are **trapped** into manipulative practices.  
- Example: Shiller’s company considered $29.99 vs $30 pricing.  
  - With no competition, they chose $30.  
  - But in a crowded market, ignoring the “.99 game” would be unsustainable.  
- **Conclusion**: manipulation often arises not from choice, but from market pressure.

## 3. Microprudential vs. Macroprudential Regulation
- **Microprudential regulation**: protects **individual investors/consumers** from abuse.  
- **Macroprudential regulation**: prevents **systemic crises** threatening the economy.  
- After 2008, the focus shifted heavily toward **macroprudential stability**.

## 4. Why Businesses Want Regulation
- Businesses may oppose **specific rules**, but overall they benefit:  
  - Regulation prevents a **race to the bottom** where only the most manipulative survive.  
  - It ensures a **level playing field**.  
- **Analogy: referees in sports**  
  - Players complain about fouls, but want referees to ensure fairness and safety.

## 5. Trade-Off and Balance
- Regulation **reduces systemic risk** but may **slow innovation** and raise compliance costs.  
- Shiller notes regulators he met were generally **competent and public-spirited**.  
- The real challenge: finding the **balance between protection and entrepreneurship**.

##  Key Takeaways
- **Phishing equilibrium** explains why manipulation persists in competitive markets.  
- Regulation must balance **consumer protection** and **systemic stability**.  
- Businesses ultimately **need regulation** to avoid destructive competition.  
- Post-2008: macroprudential policies are central to financial stability.
