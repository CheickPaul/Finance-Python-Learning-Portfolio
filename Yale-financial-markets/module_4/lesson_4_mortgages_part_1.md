# Lesson – Mortgages, Part 1 (Yale University – Coursera)

## 1. Overview of the U.S. Mortgage Market

* **Total mortgage debt**: $13.2 trillion (households).  
* **48 million mortgaged homes** in the U.S. (~1 per 6–7 people).  
* After the 2008 crisis: nearly **11 million homes (1 in 5) “underwater”** (home value < mortgage).  

### Jingle Mail
* In negative equity, homeowners could abandon homes by mailing back the keys (“jingle mail”).  
* Works mainly in **non-recourse states** → lender cannot pursue assets beyond the house.  
* In **recourse states**, lenders can sue for more, but often don’t (too costly).

## 2. Impact of Negative Equity on the Economy

* Many households (esp. young families) hold most wealth in their house.  
* When **underwater** → negative net worth → families cut spending.  
* Result: **sharp contraction in consumer demand** → recession worsened.

## 3. Evolution of Mortgage Structures

* **Pre-1930s**: Mortgages short-term (2–5 years).  
  - Relied on refinancing at maturity.  
* **Great Depression**: Unemployment + housing crash → banks refused renewals → **mass foreclosures**.  
* **1934**: Roosevelt created the **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**.  
  - FHA insured banks against borrower default.  
  - Introduced long-term mortgages (15 years, later **30 years**).  
  - Objective: stabilize housing market and restore lending.

## 4. FHA and Long-Term Trends

* FHA still active but faced solvency crises after defaults.  
* Insurance premiums: rose from **0.5% → 1.5% annually**.  
* **30-year mortgage** became the U.S. standard, esp. for young buyers.

## 5. Overvaluation vs. Undervaluation of Housing

* Public focus = bubbles (overvaluation).  
* But **undervaluation** also exists:  
  - Example: Detroit, parts of Baltimore.  
  - Homes < construction cost → no incentive to build.  
  - Potential for **value investing** if city recovers.  

Prices capped by **construction costs** on the upside, and supported by them on the downside.
