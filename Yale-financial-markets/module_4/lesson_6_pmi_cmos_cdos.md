# Lesson – PMI, CMOs, and CDOs (Yale University – Coursera)

## 1. PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)

* Introduced alongside **FHA insurance (1934)** and **VA insurance (post-WWII)**.  
* **Purpose**: protects lenders if the borrower defaults.  
* **Who pays?** The borrower (homeowner), if **down payment < 20%** of home value.  

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Rule

$$
LTV = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Property Value}} \times 100
$$

* PMI required if **LTV > 80%** (borrower equity < 20%).  

### Cancellation Rules

* Borrower may request cancellation once **LTV ≤ 80%** (with good payment history and possibly a new appraisal).  
* PMI **must be automatically terminated** at **78% LTV** (per original amortization schedule).  
* Final termination: PMI must end by the **midpoint of the loan term** if not canceled earlier.  

### Issues

* Lenders rarely notify borrowers when PMI is no longer required.  
* Many homeowners overpay for years unless they **proactively request cancellation**.  
* Some PMI companies collapsed during the **2008 financial crisis** (e.g., PMI Group Inc.).

## 2. CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations)

**Process:**

1. Banks originate mortgages.  
2. Sell them to investors as securities.  
3. Mortgages pooled together and structured into **tranches** (slices).  

**Tranches:**

* **Senior tranche (AAA)** → paid first, least risky.  
* **Mezzanine tranches (AA, A, BBB, etc.)** → more risk, higher yield.  
* **Equity tranche (“toxic waste”)** → absorbs first losses, very risky, often bought by hedge funds at deep discounts.  

**Benefit:** allows creation of **AAA-rated securities** from risky mortgage pools.

## 3. CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)

* Similar to CMOs but broader:  
  - Can include **mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt, corporate loans**, etc.  
* Also structured into **tranches with varying levels of risk**.  

**Crisis Role:**  

* Defaults reached into supposedly “safe” senior tranches.  
* **Rating agencies** overrated securities (AAA ratings proved unreliable).  
* Both CMOs and CDOs were central to the **2007–2009 financial crisis**.

## 4. Crisis Lessons

* During the crisis, **AAA tranches lost value**, though often not as catastrophically as markets feared.  
* In 2009, many CMOs and CDOs were **undervalued opportunities** for smart investors.  
* **Key insight:** Markets are **not fully efficient**, especially in times of panic.  
* Institutional investors with knowledge bought distressed assets when panic selling pushed prices too low.


 ## 5. Reflection

**In Europe:** PMI as such is rare; lenders generally prefer to limit the LTV at the time the loan is granted.

**In the U.S.:** PMI is common, but banks have no economic incentive to remind the borrower that it can be stopped → resulting in millions of borrowers overpaying for too long.
