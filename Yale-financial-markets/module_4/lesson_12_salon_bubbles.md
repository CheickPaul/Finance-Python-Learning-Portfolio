# Lesson – Salon on Bubbles

## 1. Why Invest in a Bubble?
- Even if an investor **suspects a bubble**, prices can keep rising.  
- **Shorting bubbles is difficult**:  
  - In housing → impossible to short directly.  
  - In stocks → downturn may take years, short sellers risk bankruptcy.  
- **Advisors’ dilemma**: if they tell clients to stay out too early, clients may leave before the crash.

## 2. Origin and Definition of the Term
- Word *bubble* coined in **1720** during the French stock market crash.  
- A bubble = **speculative rise driven by social contagion**:  
  - Good news spreads, bad news ignored.  
  - Prices rise → attract more buyers.  
  - Eventually, doubts emerge → fall accelerates.  
- Once rejected by economists, the term gained legitimacy after the **2007–2009 crisis**.

## 3. Metaphor: Bubble or Epidemic?
- Unlike soap bubbles, financial bubbles **do not vanish completely**; prices can rise again.  
- Shiller: *“epidemic”* is a better metaphor:  
  - Contagious spread of stories and beliefs.  
  - Narratives and theories mutate like viruses (political statements, economic news).

## 4. Why Was the 2000s Housing Bubble So Massive?
- Real estate boom was **global**: U.S., China, Spain, Italy, UK, Ireland, Iceland.  
- Key factor: dominance of the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**.  
  - Previously: leaders sometimes warned against excess.  
  - Under EMH: criticizing markets seemed “unscientific.”  
- Result: lack of counter-narratives → bubbles grew unchecked.  
- The “smart money” supposed to stabilize markets was far less visible in practice.

## 5. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
- **Definition**: asset prices fully reflect all available information → impossible to consistently beat the market.  
- **Forms**:  
  - Weak → prices reflect past data.  
  - Semi-strong → prices reflect all public info.  
  - Strong → prices reflect even insider info.  
- **Critiques**:  
  - Bubbles, crashes, and anomalies (momentum, value effect) contradict EMH.  
  - Behavioral finance (Shiller, Kahneman, Tversky) shows role of **psychology and social contagion**.

## 6. Rational Bubble?
- Some theorists: rational investors can **ride the rise** before the crash.  
- In practice: very risky.  
  - Timing the turning point is nearly impossible.  
  - Hindsight bias makes past events look “obvious.”

## 7. The Role of Short Selling
- Foundational article: **Edward Miller (1970s)**.  
- Without short selling, **fanatics can push prices to absurd levels**.  
- Practical limits:  
  - Not all shares available for shorting.
