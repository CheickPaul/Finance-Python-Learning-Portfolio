# [National Regulation, Part 2]

## Key Concepts
- National financial regulation often expands after crises to restore confidence.  
- Regulations may target **capital requirements**, **reserve ratios**, and **banking activities**.  
- Trade-off: more regulation = more stability, but also higher compliance costs and reduced risk-taking.  
- Regulatory fragmentation is common: different agencies (central bank, treasury, financial regulators) may overlap.  
- U.S. Example: Federal Reserve, SEC, CFTC, FDIC all share parts of financial oversight.  
- Tension between **uniform standards** (to ensure fairness) and **innovation** (risk of stifling markets).

## My Notes
- Regulation responds to crises (reactive rather than proactive).  
- Multiple regulators can create confusion, but also checks and balances.  
- Capital requirements (e.g., Basel accords) are key tools to prevent excessive leverage.  
- Regulation often lags behind innovation (derivatives, fintech, crypto).  
- Stricter rules can push activity offshore to less regulated markets ("regulatory arbitrage").
