# [Financialization of Housing]

## Key Concepts
- Housing is both a **consumption good** (shelter) and an **investment asset**.  
- Financialization = turning housing into tradable financial products.  
- Tools of financialization:  
  - **Mortgages** (primary market).  
  - **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** (secondary market).  
  - **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)** → structured products from MBS.  
- Benefits:  
  - Expands credit access to households.  
  - Provides new investment opportunities for institutions.  
- Risks:  
  - Increases systemic exposure to housing cycles.  
  - Encourages speculation and bubbles.  
  - Misaligned incentives (originate-to-distribute model).

## My Notes
- Housing markets became deeply linked to global finance, especially after securitization.  
- Local mortgage risks (defaults) were repackaged and spread worldwide via MBS/CDOs.  
- This globalized housing risk contributed to the **2008 financial crisis**.  
- Financialization can improve efficiency but also amplifies fragility (boom–bust cycles).  
- Denmark as a contrast: strong **covered bond** system tied to real housing collateral, limiting speculative excess.
