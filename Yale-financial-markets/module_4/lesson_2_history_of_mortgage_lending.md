# [History of Mortgage Lending]

Mortgage lending is one of the oldest forms of credit. Its history highlights how collateral, property law, and financial institutions evolved to support real estate markets.

## Origins
- The word **mortgage** comes from the Latin *mort* (death), meaning **dead pledge**.  
- Collateral has existed for centuries: if the borrower fails to repay, the lender can sell the pledged property.

## Modern Concept
- To mortgage a house means to pledge it as **collateral** in exchange for a loan.  
- If the borrower defaults, the bank repossesses and sells the property.  
- The loan depends more on the **value of the property** than on the **trustworthiness of the borrower**.

## Historical Development
- **Tang Dynasty (China):** Relatives could be fined if the borrower defaulted.  
- **18th Century (Europe):** Property ownership was unclear. People posted newspaper ads to claim rights, often leading to disputes.  
- **Late 19th Century (Germany):** Introduction of the **Grundbuch**, a centralized registry of property ownership, which improved legal clarity and reduced fraud.
