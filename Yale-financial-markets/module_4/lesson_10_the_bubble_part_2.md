# Lesson – The Bubble, Part 2: Boom and Bust in U.S. Housing

## 1. Context: U.S. Housing Boom and Bust
- Home prices **peaked in 2006**, then collapsed dramatically.  
- Surveys of new homebuyers show a clear pattern:  
  - When prices rise → belief that housing is the best long-term investment.  
  - When prices fall → this belief weakens.  
- Example of **wishful thinking bias**: buyers justify purchases with optimism.

## 2. The Problem of Short Data Horizons
- Most investors only consider **short-term price series (5–10 years)**.  
- Media rarely show **century-long housing data**.  
- Result: people assume *“prices always go up”*, ignoring historical cycles.  

---

## 3. Housing Starts as a Macro Driver
- **Housing starts** = new constructions (houses, apartments, improvements).  
- Highly volatile and strongly linked to prices:  
  - High prices → builders expand construction.  
  - Falling prices → construction collapses.  
- Example: after 2006, housing starts dropped by **80%** before recovering.

## 4. Historical Episodes
- **1970s**: housing boom with strong appreciation.  
- **1990s–2006**: largest boom in U.S. history.  
  - Prices rose to record highs.  
  - Construction surged near peak levels.  
  - Collapse triggered a severe downturn in both prices and housing starts.

## 5. The Role of Animal Spirits
- **Animal spirits** = collective optimism reinforcing bubbles.  
- Belief that housing “always” appreciates → drives speculation and overbuilding.  
- Collective beliefs are unstable and eventually **reverse sharply**.  

---

## 6. The Challenge of Bubble Prediction
- **Timing** is extremely difficult:  
  - Nobody knows exactly when a bubble bursts.  
  - Psychology can sustain irrational prices for years.  
- But ignoring reversals is dangerous:  
  - History proves **millions can be wrong simultaneously**.  
  - Bubbles **repeat across generations**.

## 7. Protecting Against Housing Bubbles

### Long-Term Data Awareness
- Use **50–100 years of housing data**.  
- Compare with long-term ratios: **price-to-income** and **price-to-rent**.  

### Macro Monitoring
- Track **housing starts, construction jobs, and mortgage growth**.  
- Extreme booms = early warning signs.  

### Diversification
- Avoid **concentration in overheated housing markets**.  
- Diversify across **regions, property types, and asset classes**.  

### Cycle Discipline
- Reduce leverage when valuations are stretched.  
- Keep liquidity to **buy after corrections**.

## Summary
The U.S. housing boom of the 1990s–2006 shows how optimism, short-sighted data, and **animal spirits** fuel bubbles.  
Housing starts amplify the cycle, as builders respond to temporary profit margins.  
When bubbles burst, the **economic consequences are severe**.  

**Investor lessons:**  
1. Do not extrapolate recent growth into the future.  
2. Anchor expectations with **long-term data**.  
3. Monitor housing activity as a **macro signal**.  
4. Maintain diversification and cycle discipline to withstand downturns.
