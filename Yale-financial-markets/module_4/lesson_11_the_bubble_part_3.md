# Lesson – The Bubble, Part 3: Overvaluation, Leverage, and Narratives

## 1. Overvaluation Perceptions in 2004
- Shiller’s surveys showed U.S. households expected **+12% annual home price growth** for the next 10 years.  
- At this pace, prices would **double in ~6 years**, even though they were already at record levels.  
- With **30-year mortgage rates ~6%**, the spread between borrowing costs and expected appreciation looked extremely attractive.

## 2. Leverage and Tax Advantages
- **Low down payments** (as little as 5%) → implied leverage of ~20:1.  
- Positive spread: **12% expected growth – 6% borrowing cost = 6 points**.  
- **Mortgage interest tax deductible**, while appreciation was taxed as **capital gains** (often deferred or exempt).  
- Result: perception of **very high returns** → strong incentive to buy.

## 3. Absence of the Word “Bubble”
- Until 2005, the term *housing bubble* was rarely used.  
- Finance courses emphasized **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**:  
  - Prices fully reflect all available information.  
  - Beating the market using public info is “impossible.”  
- Reality: bubbles show that **psychological biases and narratives** can push prices far from fundamentals.

## 4. Media Turning Point (2005)
- **The Economist (June 2005)**: cover story warning of house prices “falling like a brick.”  
- **Time Magazine (2005)**: asked “Will your house make you rich?” and promoted the renting alternative.  
- **Barron’s (2005)**: interview with Shiller predicting a **possible 50% decline** (actual ≈ 40% inflation-adjusted).  
- Result: the **psychological climate shifted** → home buying was no longer viewed as risk-free.

## 5. Post-Crisis Consequences
- By **2012**, the spread between mortgage costs and expected appreciation had disappeared.  
  - Price growth expectations ≈ **0% or negative**.  
  - Mortgage rates declined, but expectations declined even more.  
- Buying no longer looked attractive.  
- **Cultural shift**: younger generations increasingly turned to **renting** (urban lifestyles, lower optimism, skepticism about ownership).

## 6. International Extension – China
### Signs of Overheating
- Extremely high **price-to-income** and **price-to-rent** ratios.  
- **Parents financing children’s homes**, often for marriage prospects.  
- Limited ability to invest abroad → domestic capital concentrated in housing.  

### Cultural and Institutional Specificities
- **Fear of corruption** → preference for tangible assets.  
- **Male-female imbalance** → housing as a marriage prerequisite.  
- **Rapid economic growth** → belief in convergence with world’s most expensive cities.  

### Risks
- Economic slowdown.  
- Liberalization of foreign investment could redirect capital out of housing.

## Key Insight
The U.S. housing bubble illustrates how **unrealistic expectations**, amplified by **leverage and tax incentives**, can become a collective belief until media narratives flip.  
China shows that **similar dynamics can emerge globally**, shaped by local cultural and institutional factors.
