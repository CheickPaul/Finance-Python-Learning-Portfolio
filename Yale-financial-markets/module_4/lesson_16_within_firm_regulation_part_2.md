# [Within Firm Regulation, Part 2]

## 1. The Concept of “Tunneling”
Definition: Extracting value from a company by insiders (controlling shareholders, executives) at the expense of minority shareholders.

**Common methods:**
- Selling assets below market value to cronies (e.g., a factory sold at 20% of its real value).  
- Overpriced contracts with friends’ or family businesses (e.g., paying 3× the market price).  
- Overly complex contracts (e.g., 1,000 pages) so shareholders cannot detect overpricing.  
- Excessive executive compensation, justified by artificially inflated reputation.  
- Loan guarantees or inter-company loans that benefit friends’ companies (knowing repayment will never happen).  
- Expropriation of corporate opportunities (CEO diverts new business opportunities to a friend instead of the company).  
- Dilutive share issues, reducing existing shareholders’ value.  
- Insider trading: buying before good news, selling before bad news.

## 2. Duties of Directors
- **Duty of care**: act as a prudent, reasonable person would in managing the company.  
- **Duty of loyalty**: avoid conflicts of interest, prevent insiders from benefiting at shareholders’ expense.  

Note: Loyalty is not just a moral principle — it is a **legal obligation**.

## 3. Case Study: France
- **SARL Peronnet case**: Company leased a warehouse from the Peronnet family (owners) at an inflated price.  
- Minority shareholders sued, alleging tunneling.  
- **French court dismissed** the case, ruling that the contract had a legitimate purpose and that judges cannot decide if the price was “too high.”  
- **Result**: tunneling was successful.  

**Contrast:**  
- In the U.S. or U.K., courts would be more likely to treat this as tunneling.  
- This explains why stock market development has historically been stronger in Anglo-Saxon countries.

## 4. Limits and Risks of Regulation
- Too much regulation → high compliance costs, discourages firms from growing beyond certain thresholds.  
- Corrupt regulators → risk of **regulatory capture** (firms needing to pay bribes).  
- Balance is required: **regulate without paralyzing business activity**.

## 5. Spirit of Regulation
- Regulators should act with a **professional mission to serve society**, not as insensitive bureaucrats.  
- Well-designed regulation is **essential for a modern economy**.
