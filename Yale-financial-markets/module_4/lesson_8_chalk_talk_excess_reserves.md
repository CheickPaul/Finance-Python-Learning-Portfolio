# [Chalk Talks – Excess Reserves]

## 1. Context: Reserve Requirements
- Historically, banking crises often came from **bank runs**: depositors withdrew their money all at once.  
- To limit this risk, regulators imposed **reserve requirements**: a portion of deposits must remain liquid, either as cash or at the central bank.  
- These reserves are a **percentage of deposits**, not a direct tax on profits.  

---

## 2. Definition: Excess Reserves
- **Excess reserves** = reserves held **above the regulatory minimum**.  
- Before 2008: almost non-existent, since reserves earned **no interest**.  
- Banks preferred to lend funds rather than keep them idle.  

---

## 3. Why Did Banks Hold More After 2008?
- **Zero rates**: after the 2008 crisis, central banks cut rates → lending became less attractive.  
- **Post-crisis regulation**: stricter requirements discouraged risk-taking.  
- Result: massive accumulation of liquidity as excess reserves.

## 4. Consequence: Idle Money & Secular Stagnation
- Trillions of dollars remained **unused**.  
- This signaled a **lack of safe and profitable investment opportunities**.  
- Economists call this phenomenon **secular stagnation**.

## 5. Information Problems: Moral Hazard & Adverse Selection

### Moral Hazard
- **Definition**: when an insured agent changes behavior because they no longer bear the full risk.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Fire insurance → a homeowner may become careless or even commit arson.  
  - Banking → a highly indebted borrower may take on more risk, knowing losses will be shared with the bank.  
- **Solutions**:  
  - Never cover **100% of losses** (deductibles in insurance, collateral in loans).  
  - Impose **covenants** (loan clauses) to discipline borrowers.  

### Adverse Selection
- **Definition**: when market conditions attract mainly **risky agents**, driving out safer ones.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Credit: high interest rates mainly attract risky borrowers, while good borrowers exit the market.  
  - Health insurance: people in poor health are more likely to sign up.  
- **Consequences**: the lender or insurer is left with a **pool skewed toward bad risks**.  
- **Solutions**:  
  - Require collateral.  
  - Segment clients by profile (screening, risk-based pricing).  
  - Use data (credit scoring, machine learning).

## 6. How Banks Manage These Frictions
- Banking is fundamentally a **business of information and trust**.  
- Tools:  
  - Local offices and personal knowledge of clients.  
  - Quantitative analysis (data, credit scoring).  
  - Human judgment and intuition.  
- Goal: reduce risks linked to **moral hazard** and **adverse selection**, while lending effectively.  

---

## Summary
- After 2008: massive build-up of excess reserves, reflecting a shortage of safe opportunities.  
- Moral hazard and adverse selection explain why **not all loans are equal**.  
- Managing these frictions requires a mix of **data analysis** and **trust-based relationships**, which remain central to banking.
