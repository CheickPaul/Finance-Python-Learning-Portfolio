# [Post-Crisis Regulation]

## 1. Background
After the 2007–2009 financial crisis, public anger grew over:
- Mortgage originators approving risky loans (“liar’s loans”) knowing they would resell them.  
- CMOs/CDOs repackaging poor-quality mortgages and marketing them as safe investments.  

**Problem:** Banks had no incentive to check quality, since they did not retain the risk.  

---

## 2. European Response
- Rule: Mortgage originators must retain at least **5%** of the loans they issue.  
- Purpose: Align incentives → discourage reckless lending (e.g., liar’s loans).  

---

## 3. U.S. Response – Dodd-Frank Act (2010)
- Copied the **5% risk retention rule**, except for **Qualified Residential Mortgages (QRM)**.  
- QRM = “safe” mortgages that meet strict underwriting standards.  
- Dodd-Frank left regulators to define what counts as QRM.  
- Took **4 years**, with thousands of industry comments and lobbying.  
- Final rule ran **689 pages**.  

---

## 4. QRM Standards (simplified)
To be considered a QRM (and exempt from 5% retention), a mortgage must:  

- Have equal or substantially equal payments (no teaser rates leading to payment shocks).  
- No negative amortization (loan balance can’t grow).  
- No balloon payments at the end (must be annuity-style).  
- Max term = **30 years**.  
- Points and fees ≤ **3% of loan amount**.  
- For ARMs: use the **max interest rate in the first 5 years** when testing affordability.  
- Borrower’s income and assets must be verified (no more “stated income” loans).  
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio ≤ **43%**.  

Notably: **No explicit Loan-to-Value (LTV) cap** in the U.S. (other countries often set max LTV, e.g., 90%).

## 5. Implications
Post-crisis, mortgages in the U.S. are far more regulated.  

A standard **QRM mortgage** today looks like:  
- 30-year fixed  
- Fully documented income/assets  
- DTI < 43%  
- No exotic features (negative amortization, balloon payments).
