## 2. Role of the Board of Directors
- Standard practice worldwide.  
- Usually includes **outside directors** from different professional backgrounds.  
- Main responsibilities:  
  - Hire and fire the president/CEO.  
  - Provide oversight and guidance.  
- Typically a **part-time role** – directors are active in other fields, bringing diverse perspectives.  
- Chosen for their **reputation and credibility**, which acts as protection against misconduct.  

---

## 3. Safeguards Against Misconduct
- Directors are selected to avoid individuals with **antisocial or untrustworthy traits**.  
- Reputation is key: credible directors won’t risk it by allowing **fraudulent practices**.  
- Reputation-based governance helps prevent manipulation and misconduct.  

**Example of misconduct:** *Tunneling*.

## 4. The Concept of “Tunneling”
- Defined by Johnson, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2000).  
- Refers to **expropriation by minority shareholders, directors, or officers**.  
- Comparable to stealing money through an underground tunnel.  
- A subtle and difficult-to-detect form of fraud.

## 5. Common Law vs Civil Law in Preventing Tunneling
- **Common Law (U.S., U.K.)**  
  - Courts create **precedent-based law** in addition to legislation.  
  - Judges decide specific disputes, closely tied to real human issues.  
  - More effective in addressing tunneling.  

- **Civil Law (continental Europe)**  
  - Law is entirely **legislative**, no precedent.  
  - Less flexible → tunneling more frequent.  

**Conclusion (Johnson et al.):**  
- Tunneling is **more common in civil law countries**.  
- Common law systems provide **stronger protection** against corporate abuse.

## Key Takeaway
Within-firm regulation relies on **corporate governance** (boards with credible directors) and is reinforced by the **legal system**.  
Common law systems (U.S., U.K.) appear better equipped to prevent subtle corporate fraud like tunneling.
