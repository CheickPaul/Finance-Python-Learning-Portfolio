# Lesson – National Regulation, Part 1

## 1. Too Much Regulation?
- Example: **China**  
  - Still an emerging country with significant corruption issues.  
  - Strong need for regulation and anti-corruption campaigns (e.g., Xi Jinping).  
  - General idea: corruption is more common in early development stages but tends to decline as resources for proper regulation and enforcement increase.

## 2. Creation of the SEC (1934)
- Context: regulation could not remain local, since financial activities cross state borders.  
- Initially opposed as a federal “power grab.”  
- Inspired by Louis Brandeis and the principle of disclosure.  
- Famous quote: **“Sunshine is the best disinfectant.”**  
- Public companies must publish balance sheets and profit & loss statements.

## 3. How the SEC Works
- **EDGAR database** provides public access to financial statements.  
- Aim: clear, standardized, accessible disclosure (not hidden in fine print).  
- William O. Douglas (Yale Law, Legal Realist Movement) pushed for **practical, human-centered regulation**.  
- Author of *Democracy and Finance* (1940).

## 4. Capture and Conflicts
- Example: Arthur Levitt, SEC chair, faced political pushback when targeting wrongdoing.  
- Historical case: brokers’ commissions were **fixed until 1975** (legacy of the Buttonwood Agreement).

## 5. Public vs Private Securities
- **Public securities**: require SEC approval and registration (IPO, quarterly filings).  
- **Private companies**: avoid disclosure, sometimes to protect secrets (e.g., hedge funds).

## 6. Hedge Funds and Accredited Investors
- Exemptions defined in SEC rules:  
  - **3c1 funds**: max 99 investors, each must be an accredited investor (≥ $200k annual income or ≥ $1M in assets excluding main residence).  
  - **3c7 funds**: max 500 investors, each must be a qualified purchaser (≥ $5M net worth; institutions ≥ $25M).  
- Purpose: protect small investors and small institutions from risky products.

## 7. Conclusion
- National regulation emphasizes **disclosure, registration, and investor protection**.  
- The SEC does not guarantee that an investment is “good” — it only enforces transparency.
