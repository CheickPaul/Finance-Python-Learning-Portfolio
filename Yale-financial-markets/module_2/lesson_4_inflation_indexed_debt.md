# [Lesson 4 – Inflation-Indexed Debt]

## Key Concepts
1. Traditional debt contracts are denominated in currency, which loses value when governments **print money** or mismanage monetary policy.  
2. Inflation-indexed bonds protect creditors by tying payments to a **price index** (real terms instead of nominal).  
3. Early examples:  
   - **Rice bonds** in Japan → debt payable in rice, safer than unstable currency but not a general price index.  
   - **Massachusetts (1780)** → first U.S. inflation-indexed bonds issued during the Revolutionary War to pay soldiers amid high inflation.  
4. Despite being logical, inflation-indexed bonds were rarely used until **1997**, when the U.S. Treasury finally issued TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities).  
5. Purpose: safeguard **purchasing power**, provide **credibility** to borrowers, and avoid social unrest linked to unfair devaluations.  

## My Notes
- Inflation erodes debt value → indexed bonds solve this by guaranteeing **real returns**.  
- First used in 1780 U.S. → response to soldier unrest and rapid inflation.  
- Shays’ Rebellion showed resentment from creditors not receiving similar protections.  
- U.S. Treasury long resisted inflation-indexed bonds, joking that only economists would care.  
- In reality, these bonds are critical: even modest inflation (e.g., 4%/year) cuts wealth in half in ~20 years.  

## Reflection
Inflation-indexed bonds are one of the most powerful financial innovations to protect savings and pensions.
