# Lesson 2 – Salon: Innovation

## Key Concepts
- Innovation in finance emerges slowly, often facing skepticism.  
- Many important products (insurance, pensions, mortgages) started small and expanded only after decades.  
- The role of **regulation and trust** is central for adoption.  
- Financial innovations usually spread when they solve a widespread problem.  

## My Notes
- Finance is not “instant innovation” like an app; it requires decades of social and legal validation.  
- Discussions in the salon highlight how trust is a key bottleneck for innovation.  
- I see parallels with algorithmic trading strategies: even if profitable, they need credibility and robustness before wide acceptance.
