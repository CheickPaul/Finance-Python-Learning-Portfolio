# Lesson 5 – Unidad de Fomento (UF)

## Key Concepts
- **Idea**: Split the functions of money. Keep the **unit of account** separate from the **medium of exchange** by indexing the unit of account to inflation.  
- **Chile, 1967**: Creation of the **Unidad de Fomento (UF)**, a CPI-linked unit of account designed during very high inflation.  
- **Mechanism**: Authorities publish the UF–currency conversion (historically in newspapers; now online). Contracts are **denominated in UF** while payments settle in pesos at the UF rate of the day.  
- **Purpose**: Preserve **real purchasing power** in long-term contracts and savings; avoid the “payday dash” where wages are spent immediately before inflation erodes value.  
- **Precedents**: “Rice bonds” (payable in rice) show commodity-denominated debt, but a **broad price index** is superior to a single commodity.  
- **History & Adoption**: Early U.S. example (Massachusetts, **1780**) issued inflation-indexed debt during wartime inflation. Despite its logic, widespread adoption was **slow**; the U.S. Treasury only issued TIPS in **1997**.  
- **Human factor**: Psychological and political reluctance—people underestimate inflation risk (“only 2%”), and officials hesitate to acknowledge the possibility of higher inflation.  
- **Context**: Even “stable” countries see substantial cumulative inflation over decades (long-horizon erosion of savings), reinforcing the case for indexed units of account.

## My Notes
- UF = **CPI-linked unit of account**; prices, wages, and contracts can be quoted in UF to **neutralize inflation** while day-to-day payments still use local currency.  
- Key benefit vs commodity-linked contracts: indexing to a **broad CPI** stabilizes real value across the consumption basket, not just one good.  
- The **1780 Massachusetts** episode shows indexation arises from **necessity** (soldier unrest under rapid inflation).  
- **Adoption lag** is striking: clear economic logic, but **behavioral, political, and institutional frictions** delay implementation for decades.  
- Practical takeaway: for pensions, mortgages, alimony, and long-dated savings, **index-denominated contracts** (UF-style) materially reduce inflation risk.
