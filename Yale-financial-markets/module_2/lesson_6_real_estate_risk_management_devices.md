# Lesson 6 – Real Estate Risk Management

## Key Concepts
- **Risk map (household & lender)**: 
  - **Market risk**: house price cycles, local supply/demand shocks, construction booms.
  - **Rate risk**: refinancing risk, payment shock on ARMs, duration/convexity on fixed-rate loans.
  - **Income risk**: unemployment, illness → default probability.
  - **Liquidity risk**: selling in downturns (illiquid market, wide bid–ask).
  - **Regulatory/tax risk**: LTV caps, deductibility of interest, rent control changes.
  - **Catastrophe risk**: flood, quake, storm—correlated tail losses.
- **Core tools**:
  - **Loan design**: fixed vs ARM, hybrid ARMs, rate caps/floors, interest-only periods, amortization schedule.
  - **Underwriting**: LTV, DTI, DSCR, FICO; mortgage insurance (PMI), guarantees.
  - **Hedging**: use of swaps, swaptions, MBS/TBA to manage pipeline and prepayment risk.
  - **Diversification**: geographic spread of exposures; avoid mono-line local concentration.
  - **Buffers & tests**: down payment buffers, emergency fund; **VaR/stress tests** on income, rates, and prices.
- **Prepayment & convexity**: falling rates → prepayments rise → negative convexity for lenders/investors in MBS.
- **Securitization vs. balance sheet**: originate-to-distribute transfers risk; covered bonds keep skin-in-the-game with matched funding.
- **Indexation to inflation**: CPI-linked **units of account** (e.g., Chile’s **UF**) can stabilize real debt burdens and rents in high-inflation contexts.

## My Notes
- For households, **two levers dominate**: (1) **LTV** at purchase (higher equity cushion lowers default risk), (2) **rate type** (fixed for payment stability; ARM for lower initial cost but with reset risk).
- **Refinancing discipline**: refinance only when break-even (closing costs vs. payment savings) is reached; avoid resetting term to 30y repeatedly (amortization drag).
- **Stress my budget**: +300 bps rate shock, –20% home price, –10% income—ensure cash runway ≥ 6 months.
- **Insurance stack**: homeowners + catastrophe riders; consider **mortgage insurance** if LTV > 80% only until LTV improves (remove PMI promptly).
- **Lender perspective**: pipeline hedging with TBAs; manage **prepayment risk** and **extension risk** around rate moves.
- **Inflation angle**: where feasible, **index-linked mortgages/rents** (UF-style) preserve real values and reduce conflict when inflation spikes; otherwise, prefer fixed-rate debt if inflation risk is to the upside.
- **Portfolio view**: avoid geographic concentration; combine urban and suburban exposures; check local employment mix (tourism/tech/industrial) to gauge correlated shocks.
- **Exit planning**: list liquidity triggers (job move, family change) and maintain **sale contingency plan** to avoid forced sale in downturns.
