# [Lesson 3 – Limited Liability]

## Key Concepts
1. Before 1811, shareholders were personally responsible for the actions of company managers.  
2. After limited liability laws, owners and managers became legally separate.  
3. Investors tend to **underestimate small probabilities of big losses**, similar to buying lottery tickets.  
4. Limited liability is a cornerstone of modern finance, enabling large-scale investment and corporate growth.

## My Notes
- Before limited liability: extreme personal risk → discouraged outside investment.  
- With limited liability: investors only risk what they put in, nothing more.  
- This structure encourages entrepreneurship and capital formation.  
- Downside: investors often ignore rare catastrophic risks because their exposure is capped.  

## Reflection
Limited liability protects investors and allows companies to raise large amounts of capital. Without it, modern corporations and markets could not exist.  

But this protection also creates **systemic fragility**:  
- Investors become more willing to take risks, since the **worst-case loss is limited**.  
- This encourages **collective optimism**, fueling bubbles as money pours into risky ventures.  
- When reality hits, these underestimated risks materialize, leading to **sharp crashes**.
