# Lesson 3 – Limited Liability

## Key Concepts
- Before 1811, shareholders were **personally responsible** for company debts and managers’ actions.  
- The 1811 New York law introduced **limited liability**: investors could only lose what they put in.  
- Separation between **ownership** and **management** changed the scale of modern capitalism.  
- Limited liability encourages more people to invest but also creates potential **moral hazard**.  
- Investors often **underestimate risk**, similar to buying lottery tickets—focusing on upside and neglecting small probabilities of large losses.  

## My Notes
- The legal innovation of limited liability was revolutionary: it unlocked massive growth of corporations.  
- It made investing accessible to the broader public since risks were capped.  
- But it also means investors sometimes become **over-optimistic**, ignoring low-probability catastrophic outcomes.  
- This parallels trading psychology: traders may overweight small chances of big wins while underestimating the tail risks.  

## Reflection
- Limited liability is a cornerstone of modern finance, but it also explains why bubbles and crashes keep happening.
