# Lesson 1 – Invention Takes Time

## Key Concepts
- Financial innovations often take decades to gain trust and adoption.  
- Examples: life insurance, pensions, and mortgages.  
- Adoption is slowed by caution with money, lack of trust, and need for regulation.  
- Over time, successful inventions become standardized and embedded in daily life.  

## My Notes
- New financial products are rarely accepted immediately.  
- Historical examples show that even “obvious” ideas needed decades to be legitimized.  
- Regulation plays a big role in building credibility and trust.  
- Reminds me of how ETFs also took time to dominate markets despite their efficiency.
