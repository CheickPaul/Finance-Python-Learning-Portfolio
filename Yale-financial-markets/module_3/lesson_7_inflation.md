# Lesson 7 – Inflation

## Key Concepts

- **Nominal Rate ($r_n$)**  
  - Expressed in dollars.  
  - Not adjusted for inflation.  

- **Real Rate ($r_r$)**  
  - Expressed in terms of purchasing power (market baskets).  
  - Adjusts for the erosion of money’s value.  

- **Fisher Equation**  
  The link between nominal rate, real rate, and expected inflation ($\pi^e$):  

  $$
  1 + r_n = (1 + r_r)(1 + \pi^e)
  $$

  Approximated (for small rates):  

  $$
  r_n \approx r_r + \pi^e
  $$

- **Index Bonds (Inflation-Linked Bonds)**  
  - Pay coupons and principal **indexed to inflation**.  
  - Protect investors from inflation risk.  
  - Example: U.S. **TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)**.

## My Notes

- Inflation erodes the value of money, making **nominal returns misleading**.  
- The **real rate** is what matters for long-term investment decisions.  
- Index bonds are crucial tools for hedging inflation risk, especially for pension funds and insurance companies with **long-term liabilities**.  
- In practice:  
  - Nominal rates are usually **greater than real rates**, since they embed expected inflation.  
  - A sudden rise in inflation expectations pushes up nominal yields quickly.

## Reflection

As a trader:  

- If I expect **inflation to rise faster** than the market, I should **short nominal bonds** (prices fall when yields rise).  
- I can hedge this by buying **inflation-linked bonds (TIPS, OATi in France)**.  
- Monitoring the spread between **nominal and real yields** (called the **breakeven inflation**) is a key way to read **market inflation expectations**.  

**Breakeven formula:**  

$$
\pi^e_t \approx r^{nominal}_t - r^{real}_t
$$

This breakeven is widely used by traders to gauge if inflation protection is overpriced or underpriced.

## Takeaway

- Distinguish carefully between **nominal** and **real** rates.  
- Inflation-linked securities provide direct hedging tools.  
- The **Fisher equation** is the theoretical backbone linking the two.  
- For trading: the **breakeven spread** is the main arbitrage signal between nominal bonds and TIPS.
