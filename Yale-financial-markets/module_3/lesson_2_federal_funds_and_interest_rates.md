# Lesson 2 – Discount Bonds

## Key Concepts
- **Discount bonds** pay **no coupons**; only one payment at maturity.
- Price = **Present Discounted Value (PDV)** of future cash flow(s).
- The interest rate \( r \) links today’s value and future value.

## My Notes
- A discount bond is the cleanest example of **time value of money**.  
- The pricing is straightforward:  

### 1. PDV of $1 in One Year
$$
PDV = \frac{1}{1+r}
$$

### 2. PDV of $1 in \( n \) Years
$$
PDV = \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}
$$

### 3. PDV of a Stream of Payments
For payments \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \):

$$
PDV = \frac{X_1}{1+r} + \frac{X_2}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots + \frac{X_n}{(1+r)^n}
$$

- Discount bonds are typically **short-term instruments** (e.g., 6-month T-bills).  
- Their simplicity makes them a foundation for **more complex bonds** with coupons.  

## Reflection
- Discount bonds illustrate the **core principle of discounting**: money in the future is worth less today.  
- This is the starting point for valuing **bonds, annuities, stocks, and derivatives**.
