# Lesson 11 â€“ Shares and Dividends

## Key Concepts

- **Shares**  
  - Represent **ownership in a corporation**.  
  - Two main types: **Common Stock** and **Preferred Stock**.  

- **Common Stock**  
  - Voting rights: usually **1 share = 1 vote**.  
  - Dividends: variable, not guaranteed.  
  - Last in line in case of liquidation.  
  - Price: more volatile, equity-like.  

- **Preferred Stock**  
  - Typically **no voting rights**.  
  - Fixed dividends, paid before common stock.  
  - Higher priority in liquidation.  
  - Lower volatility, more bond-like.  
  - Sometimes convertible into common shares.  

- **Dividends**  
  - Cash payments distributed to shareholders.  
  - Decision made by the **board of directors**.  
  - Reflect profitability and financial policy.  
  - Alternatives: share repurchases (buybacks).  

- **Corporate Charter Principle**  
  - Shareholders in the same class must be treated **equally**.

## My Notes

- Common = **ownership + risk + upside**.  
- Preferred = **hybrid between bond and equity**.  
- Dividends = not mandatory, but often signal **financial strength**.  
- Shareholder equality is crucial: prevents discrimination within the same share class.  
- Buybacks are sometimes more tax-efficient than dividends, but investors like the **regularity** of dividends.

## Takeaway

- **Common stock** = ownership with voting rights, high risk, and upside.  
- **Preferred stock** = hybrid security with fixed dividends, lower risk, and priority in liquidation.  
- **Dividends** and **buybacks** are central to shareholder returns and valuation.  
- Corporate governance ensures **equal treatment** within share classes.
