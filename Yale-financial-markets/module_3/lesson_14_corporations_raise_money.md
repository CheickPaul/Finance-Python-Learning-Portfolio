# Lesson 14 – How Corporations Raise Money  

## Key Concepts  

- **Sources of Corporate Financing**  
  1. **Retained Earnings**  
     - Profits kept within the firm instead of being distributed as dividends.  
     - Cheapest and most flexible financing source.  

  2. **Debt Financing**  
     - Bank loans or bonds issued to investors.  
     - Creates fixed obligations (interest + principal).  
     - Advantage: no dilution of ownership.  
     - Risk: default if cash flows are insufficient.  

  3. **Equity Financing (Issuing Shares)**  
     - Selling ownership stakes to new investors.  
     - Advantage: no fixed repayment.  
     - Risk: **dilution** of existing shareholders.  

- **Impact of Share Price on Equity Financing**  
  - **High share price** → company raises more money with fewer new shares → less dilution.  
  - **Low share price** → issuing shares causes heavy dilution → companies may avoid equity issuance and prefer debt.  

- **Market Dynamics**  
  - Financing decisions depend on **valuation, market timing, and investor appetite**.  
  - Example: tech companies often issue equity when prices are high to fund growth.  
  - Mature companies prefer retained earnings and debt.

## My Notes  

- Companies always balance between **control (equity)** and **obligations (debt)**.  
- Retained earnings are the cleanest option but limited by profitability.  
- Issuing new shares is very sensitive to market conditions → “timing the market” becomes strategic.  
- Debt is cheaper in tax terms (interest deductible) but increases leverage and risk.
