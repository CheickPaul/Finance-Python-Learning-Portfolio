# Lesson 1 – Saving Accounts

## Key Concepts
- A **saving account** is the simplest financial contract: deposit now, withdraw later with interest.
- Forms the basis of the **time value of money**.
- **Future Value (FV):** what a sum today will grow into after compounding.  
- **Present Discounted Value (PDV):** value today of money received in the future.

## My Notes
- Saving accounts = foundation of finance, because they connect **present vs. future consumption**.  
- Important formulas:  

  - Future Value after *n* years at rate *r*:  
    `FV = (1 + r)^n × PV`

  - Present Discounted Value of 1 received in *n* years:  
    `PDV = 1 / (1 + r)^n`

- These concepts extend directly to **bonds, annuities, and stocks**.  
- Everything in financial markets boils down to **discounting future cash flows**.  

## Reflection
- This lesson reminds me that **finance = intertemporal choice**: shifting consumption between today and tomorrow.  
- In trading or investing, every decision implicitly uses PDV — whether valuing bonds, equities, or even derivatives.  
- For me, the saving account is like the **“unit test” of finance**: if I master discounting here, I can scale it to complex assets.  
- It also highlights that **risk-free rates** are not abstract—they are grounded in simple saving contracts, yet they underpin pricing models like CAPM or Black–Scholes.
