# Lesson 1 – Saving Accounts

## Key Concepts
- A **saving account** is the simplest financial contract: deposit now, withdraw later with interest.
- Forms the basis of the **time value of money**.
- **Future Value (FV):** what a sum today will grow into after compounding.  
- **Present Discounted Value (PDV):** value today of money received in the future.

## My Notes
- Saving accounts = foundation of finance, because they connect **present vs. future consumption**.  
- Important formulas:  

### Future Value (FV)
For a present value \( PV \), interest rate \( r \), and horizon \( n \) years:

$$
FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n
$$

### Present Discounted Value (PDV)
For \$1 received in \( n \) years at interest rate \( r \):

$$
PDV = \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}
$$

- These formulas extend directly to **bonds, annuities, and stocks**.  
- Everything in financial markets boils down to **discounting future cash flows**.  

## Reflection
- This lesson reminds me that **finance = intertemporal choice**: shifting consumption between today and tomorrow.  
- In trading or investing, every decision implicitly uses PDV — whether valuing bonds, equities, or even derivatives.
