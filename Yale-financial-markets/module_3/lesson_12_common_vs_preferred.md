# Lesson 12 â€“ Common vs Preferred Stock

## Key Concepts

- **Common Stock**
  - Represents true ownership with **voting rights** (usually 1 share = 1 vote).
  - Dividends: variable and **not guaranteed**.
  - Last in line in case of **liquidation**.
  - More volatile, equity-like behavior.
  - Higher long-term growth potential but higher risk.

- **Preferred Stock**
  - Usually **no voting rights**.
  - Dividends: fixed and paid **before common stock**.
  - Higher claim in case of **liquidation**.
  - More stable, bond-like instrument.
  - Sometimes **convertible** into common stock.

## My Notes

- Common stock = **upside potential + governance power**.  
- Preferred stock = **income stability + priority in claims**, but less upside.  
- Preferred stock is often attractive for **income-oriented investors** (fixed dividends).  
- Conversion options create **hybrid securities** that mix features of equity and debt.  
- Dividends are central: firms avoid cutting them on preferred shares, as this damages credibility.

## Takeaway

- **Common stock** = growth + control, but highest risk.  
- **Preferred stock** = stability + priority, but limited upside.  
- For investors: choice depends on **risk appetite** (growth vs stability).  
- For traders: mispricings between common and preferred shares can provide **relative value opportunities**.
