# Lesson 12 – Common vs Preferred Stock

## Key Concepts

- **Common Stock**
  - Represents true ownership with **voting rights** (usually 1 share = 1 vote).
  - Dividends: variable and **not guaranteed**.
  - Last in line in case of **liquidation**.
  - More volatile, equity-like behavior.
  - Higher long-term growth potential but higher risk.

- **Preferred Stock**
  - Usually **no voting rights**.
  - Dividends: fixed and paid **before common stock**.
  - Higher claim in case of **liquidation**.
  - More stable, bond-like instrument.
  - Sometimes **convertible** into common stock.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Voting rights**       | Usually yes              | Usually no                |

## My Notes

- Common stock = **upside potential + governance power**.  
- Preferred stock = **income stability + priority in claims**, but less upside.  
- Preferred stock is often attractive for **income-oriented investors** (fixed dividends).  
- Conversion options create **hybrid securities** that mix features of equity and debt.  
- Dividends are central: firms avoid cutting them on preferred shares, as this damages credibility.

## Takeaway

- **Common stock** = growth + control, but highest risk.  
- **Preferred stock** = stability + priority, but limited upside.  
- For investors: choice depends on **risk appetite** (growth vs stability).  
- For traders: mispricings between common and preferred shares can provide **relative value opportunities**.  

## Research & Reflection

# How to Invest in Preferred Stock  

## 1. Direct Investment – Listed Preferred Shares  
- Many large companies (banks, utilities, conglomerates) issue **preferred shares traded on exchanges**.  
- They trade like common stocks through an **online broker** (Interactive Brokers, DEGIRO, etc.).  
- Ticker: often the company’s symbol + a suffix (e.g., *Bank of America Preferred Series L* = BAC-L).  
- Liquidity: usually lower than common stock, with wider spreads.  

## 2. Preferred Stock ETFs  
- To avoid single-issuer risk, you can buy **specialized ETFs**.  
- U.S. examples:  
  - **iShares Preferred & Income Securities ETF (PFF)**  
  - **Invesco Preferred ETF (PGX)**  
- Advantage: diversification, regular dividend distribution.  
- Disadvantage: management fees and heavy exposure to U.S. banks.  

## 3. Mutual Funds / Closed-End Funds  
- Some actively managed funds invest in preferred stock.  
- Often **Closed-End Funds (CEFs)** with leverage → higher yields but also higher risk.  

## 4. Primary Market (rare for individuals)  
- Institutions or accredited investors can subscribe directly to **new preferred issues**.  
- For retail investors, this is difficult → the simplest path is the **secondary market** (exchanges).

# Practical Considerations  

- **Dividends**: usually fixed (e.g., 6% annually on par value). But they can be suspended if the issuer faces trouble.  
- **Call Risk**: many preferred shares are **callable** → the issuer can redeem them at par if interest rates fall.  
- **Taxation**: varies by country. In the U.S., some distributions are *qualified dividends* (lower tax rate), others are treated like interest. In Europe, usually taxed as regular dividends.  
- **Credit Risk**: most preferreds are issued by banks, so they are sensitive to the issuer’s financial health.
