# Lesson 8 – Leverage

## Key Concepts

- **Definition**  
  Leverage = using **borrowed money** to increase exposure to an asset.  
  It amplifies both gains and losses.

- **Leverage Ratio**

$$
\text{Leverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Equity}}
$$

- **Return on Equity (ROE) with leverage**  

If  
- \( R_A \) = return on assets,  
- \( r_d \) = cost of debt,  
- \( D \) = debt,  
- \( E \) = equity,  

then:

$$
ROE = R_A + \frac{D}{E}(R_A - r_d)
$$

- **Risk Effect**  
  Variance of equity returns increases with leverage:

$$
\sigma^2_{Equity} \approx \left( 1 + \frac{D}{E} \right)^2 \sigma^2_{Assets}
$$

## My Notes

- Leverage = **double-edged sword**.  
- Small changes in asset returns are **magnified** on equity due to debt.  
- In crises, high leverage often leads to **forced sales** or **bankruptcies**.  
- Many financial institutions collapse not from poor assets, but from **too much leverage**.

---

## Takeaway

- Leverage increases both **potential return** and **risk**.  
- Proper formulas show how **ROE** and **risk variance** scale with \( D/E \).  
- Leverage is not “bad” in itself — it’s a **tool**, but it requires **strict risk control**.
