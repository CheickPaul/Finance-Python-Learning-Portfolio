# Lesson 13 – Corporate Charter & Shareholder Rights  

## Key Concepts  

- **Corporate Charter**  
  - A corporation is treated as a **legal person** (an artificial entity).  
  - Shareholders are the “owners” but with **limited liability** (they can only lose what they invest).  
  - The charter defines:  
    - Classes of shares (common, preferred).  
    - Voting rights and dividend rights.  
    - Rules for electing the Board of Directors.  

- **Equality of Shareholders**  
  - Within the same share class, all shareholders have **equal rights**.  
  - One share = one vote.  
  - All receive the same treatment in dividends and liquidation priority.  

- **Board of Directors**  
  - Elected by shareholders.  
  - Oversees the CEO and management.  
  - Protects shareholder interests, sets long-term strategy.

## My Notes  

- Equity = a **claim of ownership** with proportional rights.  
- Voting is central: it gives shareholders influence on governance.  
- Dividends and liquidation rights differ across classes (common vs preferred).  
- The charter is like the “constitution” of a corporation: it sets the rules of the game.
