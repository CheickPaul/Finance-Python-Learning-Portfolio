# Lesson 16 – Share Repurchase  

## Key Concepts  

- **Definition**  
  - A share repurchase (buyback) occurs when a company buys back its own shares from the market.  
  - The total number of shares outstanding decreases, increasing each remaining shareholder’s ownership percentage.  

- **Reasons for Repurchases**  
  1. **Increase EPS** → with fewer shares outstanding, earnings per share rise.  
  2. **Return value to shareholders** → alternative to dividends, sometimes more tax-efficient.  
  3. **Signal confidence** → management may believe the stock is undervalued.  
  4. **Offset dilution** → counteracts new shares issued via stock options or convertible bonds.  

- **Consequences**  
  - Ownership % of remaining shareholders increases.  
  - Can boost stock price in the short term.  
  - If financed by debt, repurchases increase leverage and risk.  
  - Overuse may harm long-term investment capacity.

## My Notes  

- Share buybacks are very common in the U.S. but less so in Europe (dividends remain the main payout method there).  
- They are often criticized because they can prioritize **short-term EPS growth** over **long-term investment**.  
- For trading desks, announcements of repurchase programs are typically interpreted as **bullish signals**.  
- In valuation models, buybacks reduce the denominator (shares outstanding), mechanically increasing EPS.

## Reflection  

This lesson shows that share repurchases are a **double-edged tool**:  
- They can **enhance shareholder value** when done at undervalued prices.  
- They can be **value-destructive** if done at inflated prices, only to boost short-term metrics.  
- For me as a future quant trader, the key is to monitor:  
  - **Timing of buybacks** (relative to valuation).  
  - **Funding source** (cash vs. debt).  
  - **Management incentives** (are buybacks used to inflate EPS/bonuses?).  
- In practice, a buyback announcement can be used as an **event-driven signal** in trading strategies.  
- Ultimately, both **dilution and buybacks** highlight the importance of **corporate capital allocation** in shaping equity value.

## Comparison with Dilution  

| Feature                   | **Dilution**                                                      | **Share Repurchase**                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it is**            | Issuing new shares → increases total shares outstanding.          | Company buys back its own shares → reduces total shares outstanding.              |
| **Effect on ownership %** | Your % ownership **decreases** if you don’t buy new shares.       | Your % ownership **increases** if you don’t sell shares.                          |
| **Impact on EPS**         | Usually **decreases** Earnings Per Share.                         | Usually **increases** Earnings Per Share.                                         |
| **Reason for doing it**   | Raise capital, bring in strategic investors, avoid debt.          | Return value to shareholders, tax advantages, signal confidence, offset dilution. |
| **Market perception**     | Can be seen as negative if overused (shareholder value dilution). | Often seen as positive if funded sustainably.                                     |
| **Tax effect (US)**       | No direct tax event for existing holders.                         | Potential capital gains tax, often deferred until sale.                           |
