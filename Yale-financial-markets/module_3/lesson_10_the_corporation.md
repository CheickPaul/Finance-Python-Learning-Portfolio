# Lesson 10 – The Corporation

## Key Concepts

- **Definition**  
  A **corporation** is a legal entity created by law, treated as an **artificial person**.  
  - Can own property.  
  - Can sue and be sued.  
  - Exists separately from its shareholders.  

- **For-Profit Corporations**  
  - Owned by **shareholders**.  
  - Governed by a **Board of Directors** elected by shareholders.  
  - **One share = one vote** (common governance rule).  
  - Board hires the **CEO**, who acts as an employee and reports to the board.  

- **Non-Profit Corporations**  
  - Do not have owners.  
  - Pursue a **cause or mission** (e.g., education, health, charity).  
  - Can generate profits, but cannot distribute them to shareholders.  

- **Corporate Charter**  
  - Defines the rights and responsibilities of shareholders.  
  - **Equality principle**: all shareholders in the same class have identical rights.  

- **Separation of Ownership and Control**  
  - Shareholders (owners) delegate management to the board and executives.  
  - Creates **agency problems**: managers may act in their own interest instead of maximizing shareholder value.

## My Notes

- The **corporation as a person** is a powerful abstraction:  
  - It never dies (perpetual existence).  
  - It can raise unlimited amounts of capital.  
- This legal framework is the foundation of modern capitalism.  
- The **agency problem** explains why governance, incentives, and monitoring are central in finance.  
- Non-profits illustrate that the corporate form is not only about profit but also about **organization of human activity**.

## Takeaway

- Corporations are **legal persons** that organize ownership, control, and liability.  
- Shareholders vote → boards govern → CEOs manage.  
- Non-profits show the flexibility of the corporate form beyond profit motives.  
- The system balances **capital raising, governance, and shareholder protection**, making corporations the backbone of modern financial markets.
