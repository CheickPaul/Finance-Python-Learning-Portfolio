# Lesson 18 – Why Do Firms Pay Dividends?

## Key Concepts
- **Dividend definition**: a cash (or stock) distribution to shareholders, reducing retained earnings.  
- **Classical puzzle**:  
  - In a perfect market (no taxes, no frictions), dividend policy should not matter (Miller–Modigliani theorem).  
  - Yet firms do pay dividends, often consistently.  
- **Possible explanations**:  
  1. **Signaling theory**: Dividends send a credible signal of profitability and stability.  
  2. **Clientele effect**: Different investors prefer different payout policies (e.g., retirees prefer dividends, growth investors prefer reinvestment).  
  3. **Agency costs**: Dividends reduce free cash flow under managers’ control, limiting wasteful spending.  
  4. **Behavioral / cultural norms**: Historical expectation that firms “share” profits.

## My Notes
- Dividends are not rationally required by theory, but markets react positively to stable or increasing dividends.  
- Cutting dividends is often interpreted as a **negative signal**, even if it could free cash for good investments.  
- Many modern firms (especially in tech) prefer **stock buybacks** instead, for flexibility and tax efficiency.  
- The U.S. has seen a **shift from dividends to buybacks** since the 1980s.  
- Despite this, traditional “dividend aristocrats” (firms that have raised dividends for decades) remain highly valued by conservative investors.
