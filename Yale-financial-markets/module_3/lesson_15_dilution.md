# Lesson 15 – Dilution  

## Key Concepts  

- **Definition**  
  - Dilution = reduction of an existing shareholder’s **ownership percentage** when new shares are issued.  
  - Occurs when companies raise equity capital, convert bonds, or distribute stock options.  

- **Mechanics**  
  - Total shares outstanding increase, while your number of shares remains constant.  
  - Your voting power, claim on earnings, and dividends decrease proportionally.  

- **Example**  
  - Before issuance: company has **1,000 shares**, you own **100** → you hold **10%**.  
  - After issuance: company issues **500 new shares** → total = 1,500 shares.  
  - You still own **100 shares**, but now only **6.67%**.  

- **Why Companies Issue New Shares**  
  1. Raise capital for growth (projects, acquisitions, R&D).  
  2. Avoid debt (lower insolvency risk).  
  3. Bring in strategic investors.  

- **Consequences**  
  - EPS (Earnings per Share) usually decreases.  
  - Market perception can be negative if dilution is excessive.  
  - Can be offset by value creation if capital raised is invested productively.

## My Notes  

- Dilution is not always “bad” it depends on how the raised funds are used.  
- If the investment return **exceeds the cost of equity**, existing shareholders may benefit despite lower ownership.  
- In practice, dilution often happens with **employee stock options** or **convertible bonds**.  
- Important to monitor corporate actions → sometimes management uses dilution opportunistically (overvalued markets).

## Reflection  

This lesson reinforces the importance of **capital allocation discipline**.  
- For investors, dilution highlights the need to analyze not just current EPS, but **future value creation** from new capital.  
- In quant finance, dilution can be modeled as an adjustment to equity cash flows → it directly impacts **valuation models** and **earnings forecasts**.  
- Key insight: Dilution ≠ destruction of value if reinvestment returns are high. The real risk is **poor capital allocation** by management.
