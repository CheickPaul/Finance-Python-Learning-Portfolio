# Lesson – Futures Contracts

## Key Concepts
- A **futures contract** is a standardized agreement traded on an exchange to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date at a predetermined price.
- Unlike **forwards**, futures are:
  - **Standardized** (quantity, quality, delivery date, location).
  - **Exchange-traded** → more liquidity.
  - **Cleared by clearinghouses** → reduces counterparty risk.
- Futures markets emerged to solve the **limitations of forward contracts** (illiquidity, credit risk, lack of transparency).
- Initial development linked to agricultural commodities (e.g., Chicago Board of Trade).
- Today, futures cover **financial assets** (interest rates, stock indices, currencies) and **commodities** (oil, gold, grains).

## Historical Origins
- **Chicago, 19th century**: 
  - Farmers and merchants needed price certainty.
  - Exchanges created **standardized contracts** to ensure trust and tradability.
- Clearinghouses introduced to **guarantee contract performance**, acting as intermediaries.

## Mechanics of Futures
- **Daily marking to market**: gains/losses settled each day, unlike forwards.
- **Margin system**:
  - **Initial margin**: deposit required to enter a contract.
  - **Maintenance margin**: minimum balance; if breached → margin call.
- Futures can be **closed before maturity** by taking the opposite position (high liquidity).
- Rarely settled by actual delivery; most are **cash-settled**.

## Forwards vs. Futures
| Feature              | Forwards (OTC)                   | Futures (Exchange-traded)             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Customization        | Fully customized                 | Standardized                          |
| Liquidity            | Illiquid                         | Highly liquid                         |
| Counterparty risk    | High                             | Very low (clearinghouse guarantees)   |
| Settlement           | At maturity                      | Daily (mark-to-market)                |
| Typical use          | Corporations, banks              | Investors, hedgers, speculators       |

## My Notes
- Futures are essentially **evolved forwards** with better structure, liquidity, and security.
- The **mark-to-market process** is crucial: eliminates build-up of large uncollateralized exposures.
- Futures allow both **hedging** (farmers, airlines, banks) and **speculation** (traders seeking profit from price movements).
- This standardization is similar to how **options markets** developed later.

## Reflection

Without clearinghouses and standardization, widespread futures trading would not be possible.
