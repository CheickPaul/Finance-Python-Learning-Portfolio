## [Ubiquity of Options]

### 1. Options are not limited to stocks

* An **option** is a right (but not an obligation).
* Example: **mortgages** actually contain an embedded option.

  * In some **“recourse” states** (e.g., Connecticut):  
    → If you stop paying your mortgage, the bank can **sue you**, garnish your wages, or seize other assets.  
    → There is **no real option** here: you must pay no matter what.  

  * In **“non-recourse” states** (e.g., California):  
    → If you default, the bank can only **take back the house**, but cannot touch your salary or other assets.  
    → Therefore, you have an **implicit option**: you can “walk away” if the house value drops below your mortgage.  
    → This is called *“jingle mail”*: people used to mail their house keys to the bank saying “I’m leaving, take the house.”  

Here, the **house is like the underlying asset**, the **loan is like the strike**, and the **right to walk away** resembles a put option.

### 2. History of options

* Options have existed for centuries (e.g., Dutch options in the 1730s).
* But they were **not standardized**:  

  * Each contract had its own conditions (date, price, etc.).  
  * No organized market, no transparency.  

* In **1973**, the **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)** was created:  

  * For the first time, options became **standardized** (strike, maturity, contract size).  
  * This created **true liquidity** and an **organized market**.

### 3. Derivatives in everyday finance

* Many financial products accessible to retail investors (**ETFs, structured funds**) embed **options** or other derivatives.  
* Sometimes, investors **think they are buying a simple product**, but they are actually exposed to **complex derivative instruments**.

### 4. Risks of derivatives

* Warren Buffett called derivatives **“weapons of mass destruction.”**  
* Example: **2008 subprime crisis**:  

  * Banks used **swaps and CDOs** (derivatives tied to mortgage debt).  
  * When counterparties were close to bankruptcy, the whole system was threatened → domino effect.  

* Regulators’ response:  

  * **USA (Dodd-Frank Act)**: created the Office of Financial Research to monitor systemic risks.  
  * **Global (Financial Stability Board, Switzerland)**: monitoring derivative markets worldwide.

### 5. Social usefulness of derivatives

* A derivative is like **insurance**.  

  * Example: you insure your house against fire → if it burns, you’re protected.  
  * In finance: you can buy a **put** on a real estate index → protection if the market crashes.  

* Insurance and options help **reduce inequality**:  

  * Without insurance, a disaster (illness, fire, bankruptcy) can ruin someone.  
  * With insurance/derivatives, shocks are **less catastrophic** → society becomes more stable.

## Reflection

* Options are **everywhere** (not only in stock markets).  
* They provide **flexibility** (the right to exit an obligation, like walking away from a mortgage).  
* They are **very old**, but modern option markets only started in 1973.  
* They are **useful but dangerous** if poorly regulated.  
* Properly used, they act like **insurance**, reducing risks and even inequalities.
