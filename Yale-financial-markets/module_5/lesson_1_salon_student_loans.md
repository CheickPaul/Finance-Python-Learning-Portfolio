# Lesson 1 – Salon: Student Loans

## Key Concepts

### 1. Student Loan as a Bond
- A student loan can be viewed as a bond issued by the student to finance higher education.  

### 2. Equity Model & Income-Contingent Loans
- Proposal: income-contingent repayment contracts instead of fixed loans.  
- Protects students who fail to secure high-paying jobs.  
- Historical example: Yale experiment in the 1970s (with James Tobin).  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Moral hazard – incentives to underreport income.  
  - Unintended cases – e.g., marrying a wealthy spouse increased repayment obligations.  

### 3. The Student Loan Bubble
- Indications of a bubble in the U.S.:  
  - Rising anxiety about automation and AI drives young people to pursue costly education for status.  
  - In the U.S., education serves as a status symbol (no aristocracy, prestige through degrees).  
  - High willingness to borrow despite soaring tuition.  

### 4. Post-2008 Context
- Government support for universities declined after the financial crisis.  
- Even public universities became expensive.  
- Students increasingly rely on debt to finance higher education.  

### 5. Bankruptcy Constraint
- Student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy in the U.S.  
- Exception: some international MBA loans permit bankruptcy, though discouraged.  

## Takeaway
- The U.S. student loan system combines high tuition costs, social pressure, and strict repayment rules, making it financially risky.  
- Income-contingent loans may reduce risks but require careful design.  
- The market exhibits bubble-like characteristics: rising costs, high borrowing, and uncertain returns.
