# [Options Overview]

## 1. Definition
- **Option = Contract** between two parties:
  - **Buyer (Holder)** → has the right (not the obligation).  
  - **Seller (Writer)** → has the obligation if the buyer exercises.  

Two main types:  
- **Call Option** → right to buy.  
- **Put Option** → right to sell.

## 2. Difference vs Forward Contract
- **Forward**: binding obligation → both buyer and seller must transact at the future date/price.  
- **Option**: gives the buyer **choice**:
  - Exercise only if profitable.  
  - Seller receives a **premium** as compensation for risk.  

---

## 3. Economic Logic
- Buyer will exercise **only if beneficial**:  

  - Call → exercised if \( S > K \) (spot > strike).  
  - Put → exercised if \( S < K \) (spot < strike).  

- If not, the option expires worthless.  

---

## 4. Contract Terms
- **Expiration (Exercise Date)**: last day the option can be used.  
- **Strike Price (K)**: fixed price of the contract.  
- **Underlying Asset**: stock, bond, commodity, land, etc.  
- **Quantity**: specifies how many units (e.g., 100 shares).  

---

## 5. Conceptual View
- **Options = truncated claims**:  
  - Call → claim on upside *above strike*.  
  - Put → claim on downside *below strike*.  
- They allow participation in favorable movements while limiting exposure.

## 6. Real Estate Options (Applied Example)

Options exist beyond finance. In the **U.S. real estate sector**, they are widely used in development projects.  

### How It Works
- A **developer** identifies land (e.g., farmland near a city) as a potential project site.  
- Instead of committing millions upfront, the developer signs an **option contract** with the landowner:  
  - Pays a **non-refundable premium** today.  
  - Gains the **right (not obligation)** to purchase the land later at an agreed strike price.  
- If approvals and financing succeed → exercise the option.  
- If the project fails → landowner keeps the premium.  

### Why Developers Use Real Estate Options
- **Risk management**: limits exposure while awaiting permits.  
- **Flexibility**: secure land without immediate purchase.  
- **Leverage**: negotiate financing while holding the option.  
- **Win-win**: landowner earns premium even if sale never happens.  

### Examples
- **Urban development**: City agencies (e.g., CRA/LA in Los Angeles).  
- **Agriculture**: Farmers granting options for consolidation.  
- **Residential real estate**: Lease-option agreements for tenants.  
- **Private projects**: e.g., Gold Energy, LLC signing land options for expansion.  

### Legal Considerations
- Courts (Texas, New York) require precise drafting: property, price, and option terms.  
- In bankruptcy, option rights can sometimes survive → strong legal protection.

## 7. Key Takeaways
- Options provide **choice and flexibility** vs forwards (which are obligations).  
- In **finance**: exposure to upside/downside with limited risk.  
- In **real estate**: strategic tool for developers, cities, and investors to secure opportunities under uncertainty.
