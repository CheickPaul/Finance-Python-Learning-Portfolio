# [Buying, Selling, and Settlement]

## 1. Historical Origins – Dojima Exchange

- The first futures market dates back to **Dojima (Japan, 18th century)**.  
- Traders used **hand signals** (“pit trading”) to communicate buy/sell orders.  
- Trading sessions were timed with a **burning fuse**; “water men” stopped late trades with buckets of water.  
- These practices inspired modern futures markets such as the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange).

## 2. Daily Settlement and Margin Accounts

Futures contracts are **marked-to-market daily**.

A **margin account** is adjusted each day according to the profit and loss (P&L).

**Long position**
```math
\Delta \Pi_t^{\text{long}} = N \cdot M \cdot (F_t - F_{t-1})
