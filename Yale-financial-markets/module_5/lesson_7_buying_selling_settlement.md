# Lesson – Buying, Selling, and Settlement

## Key Concepts
- First organized futures exchange: **Dojima, Japan (18th century)**.  
- **Pit trading** used hand signals; sessions timed with burning fuses.  
- **Daily settlement (mark-to-market)**: margin accounts adjusted every day.  
- **Physical delivery**: if not closed before expiration, long must receive and short must deliver.  
- **Cash settlement**: introduced for assets not deliverable (e.g., indices, housing).  
- **Arbitrage and convergence**: futures must align with spot at maturity.

## My Notes
- **Corn futures**: farmer shorts to lock in selling price, food processor longs to secure supply.  
- **Oil futures (WTI, Brent)**: physically delivered at **Cushing, Oklahoma**; financial traders close positions before **First Notice Day (FND)**.  
- **Ultra Bond Futures (UB30)**: delivery basket of U.S. Treasury bonds ≥ 25 years.  
  - Seller chooses the **Cheapest-to-Deliver (CTD)** bond.  
  - **Conversion factor (CF)** adjusts pricing.  
- **S&P 500 futures**: cash-settled, avoids delivery issues, perfect for speculation & hedging.  
- **Housing futures**: only possible via cash settlement (no one delivers houses).

## Reflection
### Arbitrage & Convergence
At expiration, futures prices converge to spot:  

\[
F_T \rightarrow S_T
\]

If not, arbitrageurs intervene:  

- **Case 1: Futures undervalued** (\(F < S\))  
  - Buy futures, take delivery, sell in spot.  
  - Profit = \(S_T - F_T\).  

- **Case 2: Futures overvalued** (\(F > S\))  
  - Short futures, buy spot, deliver at maturity.  
  - Profit = \(F_T - S_T\).  

This mechanism keeps futures and spot aligned → ensures **market efficiency**.

### Physical vs. Cash Settlement
- **Physical delivery** keeps futures grounded in the real economy (e.g., oil, corn, UB30).  
- **Cash settlement** allows futures to expand into **financial indices, housing, volatility**.  
- For traders, the choice matters:  
  - **Oil/UB30** require awareness of delivery deadlines.  
  - **S&P 500** avoids operational risk → better for speculation and portfolio hedging.  

---

### Takeaway
- Futures markets evolved from **rice and corn pits** to **cash-settled derivatives** on indices and housing.  
- **Daily margining** reduces default risk.  
- **Arbitrage** guarantees efficiency at expiry.  
- **Delivery rules** shape trading strategies: hedgers often deliver, traders usually don’t.
