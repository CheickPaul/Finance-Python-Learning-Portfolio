# Lesson 2 – Forwards and Futures Introduction

## Overview
Forwards and futures are derivative contracts that involve transactions for future delivery, as opposed to the spot market which settles immediately. They are fundamental to modern financial markets because they allow us to incorporate time into pricing, producing an entire curve of prices for different delivery dates rather than a single spot price.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Function vs. Perception
- Public often misperceives futures as gambling arenas for the rich.  
- In reality, they serve a critical economic function, linking financial contracts to real business activities (e.g., grain, pork bellies).  
- Gambling is entertainment; futures exist to manage real risks in production and consumption.  

### 2. Speculation and Storage
- Public perception: many believe speculation creates shortages.  
- 1990 survey: most Americans thought storing grain makes shortages more frequent.  
- **Economic reality**:  
  - Production (e.g., grain harvest) is seasonal → storage smooths consumption across the year.  
  - Without storage, food would need to be consumed immediately after harvest.  

- **Role of speculators**:  
  - Buy when prices are low (after harvest), store the commodity.  
  - Sell when prices are higher (later in the year), releasing supply to the market.  

- **Effects**:  
  - Prevents severe shortages during off-season.  
  - Stabilizes prices over time.  
  - Ensures continuous availability of essential goods (bread, cereals).  

Conclusion: far from causing scarcity, speculation and storage provide stability and guarantee availability of resources.  

### 3. Futures Market Development
- Success of a futures market is unpredictable → the “spaghetti rule”: throw it against the wall and see if it sticks.  
- Example: Shiller & Karl Case helped launch the Home Price Futures (Chicago Mercantile Exchange).  
  - Conceptually relevant (housing risk is huge).  
  - Limited adoption → shows social dynamics and user base matter as much as economic rationale.  

### 4. Why Some Markets Succeed, Others Fail
- Successful futures markets usually emerge where:  
  - Risk is large, concentrated, and felt by professional risk managers.  
  - Market participants have incentives to hedge actively.  
- Less success in areas like single-family homes → owners are long-term holders, not active hedgers.  

## Takeaway
- Futures markets reflect **risk management needs** more than pure speculation.  
- Their existence is a **social and economic phenomenon**, not purely technical.  
- Futures transform how economies deal with **time, uncertainty, and storage**.
