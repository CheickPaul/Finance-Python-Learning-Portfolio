## [Why Options Exist]

## 1. Theoretical Justification

* **Kenneth Arrow**: argued that economic efficiency requires that *all risks are tradable*.

  * A stock is not just “one risk,” but a bundle of risks (different strike levels, maturities).
  * Options allow the market to **dissect risk** into finer components.
* **Stephen Ross (1976 – *Options and Efficiency*)**:

  * A complete set of options helps *complete the market*.
  * By introducing options with different strikes and maturities, investors can trade specific risk slices.

**Conclusion:** Options exist to improve economic efficiency by enabling risk sharing and completing markets.

## 2. Behavioral Justification

* People do not always act rationally or consider their portfolio as a whole.
* **Salience & Overreaction**: After disasters, people suddenly buy insurance (e.g., flood insurance), even though the risk was always there.
* **Put Options = Insurance**:

  * Example: An investor buys a put option to protect against a stock drop.
  * Creates a **“floor”** on losses.
* **Silver Lining Theory (Shefrin & Statman)**:

  * Investors focus on partial outcomes rather than the full portfolio.
  * Even if overall losses occur, having puts provides a “silver lining” → emotional comfort.

## 3. Sales & Misuse of Options

* Options can also be **used by salesmen to manipulate investors**.
* Example from *The Art of Selling Intangibles*:

  * A stockbroker convinces a client to write (sell) calls on their stock.
  * Presents it as having **“three sources of profit”**:

    1. Premium from selling the call.
    2. Dividends from stock ownership.
    3. Gain up to the strike price.
  * The downside (loss of unlimited upside) is minimized or hidden.
* **Key Issue:** Investors should look at the **total expected return**, not be misled by “three separate sources.”

## 4. Reflection

* **Theory**: Options complete markets by making all risks tradable.
* **Behavior**: Options cater to psychological biases (insurance, silver lining, emotional comfort).
* **Sales Practices**: Options can be exploited to mislead uninformed investors.
