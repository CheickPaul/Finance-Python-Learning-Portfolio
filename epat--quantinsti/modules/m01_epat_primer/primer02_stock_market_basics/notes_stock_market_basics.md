# 1. Introduction to Financial Market
## Markets in General
In general markets are simply the places where stuff get traded in order to make profit. When it comes to financial market the actor gather together to transact on financial instrument. Like in our day to day life, we also have Online Financial Market place (similar to amazon in real world) or Physical premise.

## The Major Financial Markets
Financial markets can be split into **Stock markets**, **Commodity markets**, **Currency Markets**, **Derivative Markets** and so on.

**Stock markets** : It's the place where we trade the share or stock of a compagny also called Stock Exchange.

    The major Stock Exchange in the world are New york Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ in USA, National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India,
    London Stock Exchange in UK, Japan Exchange Group (JPX) in Japan, Korea Exchange (KRX) in South Korea, Deutsche Börse in Germany,
    Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in Hong Kong.

**Commodity markets** : Venues where raw materials and primary products are traded often via spot and futures contracts.

     Major commodity exchanges include the CME Group (NYMEX/COMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in the United States/UK,
     the London Metal Exchange (LME) in the United Kingdom, Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) in China,Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) in China,
     and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) in China, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) in Japan, the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)
     and NCDEX in India

**Currency Markets** : Decentralized (no single central exchange or order book) and primarily OTC (over-the-counter: trades negotiated directly between participants rather than on an exchange) markets where currencies trade via spot, forwards, swaps, and options, a smaller share trades on exchanges (FX futures/options). In a decentralized Foreign Exchange (FX) market, prices and liquidity are dispersed across dealers and multiple platforms.

    Major FX platforms include EBS (Electronic Broking Services) / CME Group and Refinitiv Matching for **interbank trading**. 
    Cboe FX, LMAX Exchange, Currenex, FXall, and 360T are used primarily for **client-to-bank trading** (Electronic Communication Network /Request For Quotation workflows),
    while **exchange listed FX** (futures and options) trades on CME Group (US) and Eurex (EU) with Central CounterParty (CCP). 
      
      A central counterparty (CCP) steps in as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, novates the trades, and manages risk through margining. 
      Example: Bank A sells 10 EUR/USD contracts to Bank B on an exchange. After novation, A has a contract with the CCP (it sells to the CCP) and B has a contract with the CCP (it buys from the CCP). A and B no longer have any direct legal relationship.

**Derivative Markets** : Markets where contracts whose value comes from an underlying asset are traded. Main contract types: futures, options, forwards, swaps. There are two channels: 

    (1) **exchange-listed derivatives** (standardized) on CME Group, ICE, Eurex, and Cboe (options); 
    (2) **OTC derivatives**, trades negotiated directly between participants.

# 2. Need for Financial Markets

## Why We Need Financial Markets
In every economy,financial markets connect investor (those who bring capital on the table) to business owner and governement ( the users of this capital). Thus, thanks to this main function, the financial markets become very critical for the good health of any country's economic because they fund public projet and private expansion.

## What Financial Markets Enable

### Capital raising (primary market)
The governments finance infrastructure buy selling debts (treasury bonds), The firms finance growth (more R&D, hiring, capacity) by selling share.

### Investment access (for individual)
Instead of leaving money idle in a bank, individual can invest this money and plays a relevant role in the economy growth. Obviously, they will expect a return and reward for this investment.

## Diversification
The thousands of listed securities across stock exchanges worldwide allow investors to diversify their portfolios and to manage their risk.

## Indices as Economic health indicators
The stock indices aggregate company performance and often act as **leading indicators, a bellwether for broader ecomomy.

## Risk management (derivatives)
Firms and producers can hedge price risks using forwards, futures, options.

example: a wheat farmer who fears fall of the prices can sells wheat forwards to lock today's price and stabilize revenues.

## Summary
**Connect capital**: savers → projects (public & private).
**Enable investing**: households can grow wealth with the economy.
**Inform the cycle**: indices help track macro conditions.

## Purpose and Economic Role
