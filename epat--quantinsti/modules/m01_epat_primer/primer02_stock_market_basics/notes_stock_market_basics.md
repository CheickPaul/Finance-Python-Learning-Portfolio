## The Major Financial Markets
Financial markets can be split into **Stock markets**, **Commodity markets**, **Currency Markets**, **Derivative Markets** and so on.

**Stock markets** : It's the place where we trade the share or stock of a compagny also called Stock Exchange.

    The major Stock Exchange in the world are New york Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ in USA, National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India,
    London Stock Exchange in UK, Japan Exchange Group (JPX) in Japan, Korea Exchange (KRX) in South Korea, Deutsche Börse in Germany,
    Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in Hong Kong.

**Commodity markets** : Venues where raw materials and primary products are traded often via spot and futures contracts.

     Major commodity exchanges include the CME Group (NYMEX/COMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in the United States/UK,
     the London Metal Exchange (LME) in the United Kingdom, Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) in China,Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) in China,
     and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) in China, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) in Japan, the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)
     and NCDEX in India

**Currency Markets** : Decentralized (no single central exchange or order book) and primarily OTC (over-the-counter: trades negotiated directly between participants rather than on an exchange) markets where currencies trade via spot, forwards, swaps, and options, a smaller share trades on exchanges (FX futures/options). In a decentralized Foreign Exchange (FX) market, prices and liquidity are dispersed across dealers and multiple platforms.

    Major FX platforms include EBS (Electronic Broking Services) / CME Group and Refinitiv Matching for **interbank trading**. 
    Cboe FX, LMAX Exchange, Currenex, FXall, and 360T are used primarily for **client-to-bank trading** (Electronic Communication Network /Request For Quotation       workflows),
    while **exchange listed FX** (futures and options) trades on CME Group (US) and Eurex (EU) with Central CounterParty (CCP). 
      
      A central counterparty (CCP) steps in as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, novates the trades, and manages risk through margining. 
      Example: Bank A sells 10 EUR/USD contracts to Bank B on an exchange. After novation, A has a contract with the CCP (it sells to the CCP) and B has a               contract with the CCP (it buys from the CCP). A and B no longer have any direct legal relationship.

**Derivative Markets** : Markets where contracts whose value comes from an underlying asset are traded. Main contract types: futures, options, forwards, swaps. There are two channels: 

    (1) **exchange-listed derivatives** (standardized) on CME Group, ICE, Eurex, and Cboe (options); 
    (2) **OTC derivatives**, trades negotiated directly between participants.
