# 1. Introduction to Financial Market

### Markets in General
In general markets are simply the places where stuff get traded in order to make profit. When it comes to financial market the actor gather together to transact on financial instrument. Like in our day to day life, we also have Online Financial Market place (similar to amazon in real world) or Physical premise.

### The Major Financial Markets
Financial markets can be split into **Stock markets**, **Commodity markets**, **Currency Markets**, **Derivative Markets** and so on.

**Stock markets** : It's the place where we trade the share or stock of a compagny also called Stock Exchange.

    The major Stock Exchange in the world are New york Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ in USA, National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India,
    London Stock Exchange in UK, Japan Exchange Group (JPX) in Japan, Korea Exchange (KRX) in South Korea, Deutsche Börse in Germany,
    Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in Hong Kong.

**Commodity markets** : Venues where raw materials and primary products are traded often via spot and futures contracts.

     Major commodity exchanges include the CME Group (NYMEX/COMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in the United States/UK,
     the London Metal Exchange (LME) in the United Kingdom, Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) in China,Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) in China,
     and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) in China, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) in Japan, the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)
     and NCDEX in India

**Currency Markets** : Decentralized (no single central exchange or order book) and primarily OTC (over-the-counter: trades negotiated directly between participants rather than on an exchange) markets where currencies trade via spot, forwards, swaps, and options, a smaller share trades on exchanges (FX futures/options). In a decentralized Foreign Exchange (FX) market, prices and liquidity are dispersed across dealers and multiple platforms.

    Major FX platforms include EBS (Electronic Broking Services) / CME Group and Refinitiv Matching for **interbank trading**. 
    Cboe FX, LMAX Exchange, Currenex, FXall, and 360T are used primarily for **client-to-bank trading** (Electronic Communication Network /Request For Quotation workflows),
    while **exchange listed FX** (futures and options) trades on CME Group (US) and Eurex (EU) with Central CounterParty (CCP). 
      
      A central counterparty (CCP) steps in as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, novates the trades, and manages risk through margining. 
      Example: Bank A sells 10 EUR/USD contracts to Bank B on an exchange. After novation, A has a contract with the CCP (it sells to the CCP) and B has a contract with the CCP (it buys from the CCP). A and B no longer have any direct legal relationship.

**Derivative Markets** : Markets where contracts whose value comes from an underlying asset are traded. Main contract types: futures, options, forwards, swaps. There are two channels: 

    (1) **exchange-listed derivatives** (standardized) on CME Group, ICE, Eurex, and Cboe (options); 
    (2) **OTC derivatives**, trades negotiated directly between participants.

# 2. Need for Financial Markets

#### Why We Need Financial Markets
In every economy,financial markets connect investor (those who bring capital on the table) to business owner and governement ( the users of this capital). Thus, thanks to this main function, the financial markets become very critical for the good health of any country's economic because they fund public projet and private expansion.

####  What Financial Markets Enable

##### Capital raising (primary market)
The governments finance infrastructure buy selling debts (treasury bonds), The firms finance growth (more R&D, hiring, capacity) by selling share.

##### Investment access (for individual)
Instead of leaving money idle in a bank, individual can invest this money and plays a relevant role in the economy growth. Obviously, they will expect a return and reward for this investment.

##### Diversification
The thousands of listed securities across stock exchanges worldwide allow investors to diversify their portfolios and to manage their risk.

##### Indices as Economic health indicators
The stock indices aggregate company performance and often act as **leading indicators, a bellwether for broader ecomomy.

##### Risk management (derivatives)
Firms and producers can hedge price risks using forwards, futures, options.

example: a wheat farmer who fears fall of the prices can sells wheat forwards to lock today's price and stabilize revenues.

#### Summary
**Connect capital**: savers → projects (public & private).
**Enable investing**: households can grow wealth with the economy.
**Inform the cycle**: indices help track macro conditions.
**Manage risk**: derivatives transfer/hedge exposures rather than eliminate them.

# 3. Introduction to Financial Instrument

### Definition - What Gets Traded
Financial instrument are legal agreements where one party pay cash (or value) in exchange for a claim. According to International Accounting Standards (IAS), a Financial Instrument is any contract that creates a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument for another

In practice, when it comes to **equity**, the investor pays cash and receives an **ownership claim (shares)** which may carry **voting right** and **dividend** depending of the share class and company policy.

When it comes to **debt or bond**, the investor pays cash and receives **a creditor claim (a loan to the issuer of the debt)**. Here there are no ownership and tipically no dividend. The investor generally receives a **coupon payments (based on the bond's term)** + a **repayment of principal at maturity**

### Purpose and Economic Role
Financial markets act as a channel to move money from the investors (providers) to the users( firms/government) at the lowest cost (fast, transparent, competitive).

Simple image: pipes carrying savings to useful projects.

### Classification by Asset Class
| Equity-based | Debt-based | Currency instruments |
|---|---|---|
| Represent ownership (common shares). | Represent a loan/obligation (bonds/notes). | Neither equity nor debt, X is usually treated as a separate category. |

Identification (Tickers & Listings): Each instrument has a symbol/ticker ( Microsoft = MSFT on NASDAQ). Some shares may be traded on multiple exchanges.

### Classification by Instrument Type
| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Cash instruments | Value determined directly by the market; typically easily transferable (e.g., stocks, bonds, deposits). |
| Derivative instruments | Value derived from an underlying (equities, interest rates, FX, commodities), traded OTC or on an exchange (forwards, futures, options, swaps). |

### Trading Channels
| Channel | Description |
|---|---|
| OTC (over-the-counter) | Trades negotiated directly between participants. |
| Exchange-traded | Standardized contracts under exchange rules, often with central clearing via a CCP. |

# 4. Stocks

**What is a Stock** : A stock or a share or equity is a security that represents an ownership stake in a company. It carry rights and benefits

**Why We Buy Stocks** : Investors buy stocks to seek capital appreciation when the price rises over time, and also dividend according to the firm policy

**2 Types of Stocks** : (1) Common Stock, usually carries voting rights and gives shareholders a residual claim on dividends. (2) Preferred Stock, Typically has no voting rights but provides priority dividends and often a higher claim on assets in a liquidation


**Market Cap (Size Bucket)** : 
(1) Large-cap, multi billions companies with deep liquidity. They tend to have more stable earningsand lower volatility than smaller ones

(2) Mid-cap, sitting between Large cap and small cap they are medium sized companies with solid growth potential and generally good liquidity. 

(3) Small-cap, smaller companies with higher growth uncertainty, thinner liquidity and usually higher volatility

(4) Penny Stocks, in USA the SEC treats penny stock as shares that cost less than 5 USD. Typically outside major exchange (OTC) and they can involve low liquidity and elevated risk( wide spread, price manipulation). In other part of the world, they have their owns juriductions and features.

**Key Risks** : The main risk are firstly the price volatility. Indeed, the prices can swing in the short term and even healthy firms see fluctuation in prices. Secondly we have the bankruptcy hierarchy. In case of liquidation the common shareholders are last in line.

# 5. Primary and Secondary Market

Financial Markets have 2 main segments :  **Primary Market** and **Secondary Market**

The first one is where issuance happens and the second one where trading among investors happens.

**Primary Market (New Issue Market)** : The primary market is where a company sells its shares or bonds to the public for the first time to raise capital. Then, subscriptions are made at the issue price set by the company (and its advisors). Each offering happens once (per issuance). Typical events include the **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**, **Offer for Sale (OFS)** by existing promoters, **Rights Issues** to existing shareholders, and **Bonus Issues** of free additional shares.


**Secondary Market (Exchanges)** : The secondary market is where listed shares, bonds and others instruments are traded


**Lifecycle / Flow** : New securities are first Issue in primary → public subscribes → list on exchange → trade in secondary 


**Primary vs Secondary, Key Differences (with Actors)** :
| Dimension | Primary Market | Secondary Market |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Raise new capital for the issuer | Provide liquidity and price discovery |
| Counterparties | Company ↔ Investors | Investor ↔ Investor (via exchange/broker) |
| Cash flow | Money to the issuer | Money between investors |
| Pricing | Issue price (fixed or book-built) | Market price (supply/demand) |
| Frequency | One-time per offering | Continuous trading |
| Events | IPO, OFS, Rights, Bonus | Exchange trading, block trades, etc. |
| Key actors | Issuer (company/government); investment banks/underwriters; legal counsel and auditors; regulator/listing authority; registrar; institutional and retail subscribers | Retail and institutional investors; brokers/dealers; market makers, HFT and prop trading firms; exchanges/ATS and dark pools; clearinghouses (CCP); custodians; regulators |

# 7. Introduction to Various Intermediaries(= They facilitate others' trading)

A single trade involves more entities and not only the stock exchange. Indeed, in order to execute one trade, multiple specialized entities coordinate so that orders can be placed, matched, cleared, and settled safely. 

<h4><ins>Key Intermediaries</ins></h4>

- **Exchange (matching engine) :** Their role is to host the order book and matches buy/sell orders using its matching rules.
  
- **Broker:** The role of broker is to provide client access to markets, routes orders to venues (exchange), and offers account services and reporting. They make money by adding comissions/fees to their transaction and/or by selling retail Order Flow to Market Makers or wholesalers.
  
- **Market Maker:** His goal is to provide liquidity to the market by posting continuous 2 sided quotes (bid/ask) and filling orders as principal on venues. Their earning comes from bid-ask spread and maker rebates. Its key risk is informed flow orders likely driven by new informations whose can move price against them. They mitigate this riks by widening the spreads, adjusting size and hedging quickly.
  
- **Clearing member / Clearing house:** They sit between buyers and sellers after a trade. It novates the trade (becomes buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer) and manage counterparty risk via marging (initial + daily variation) and a well structured **default waterfall:**

[ 1. Defaulter's Margin → 2. Defaulter’s default-fund contribution ( Default fund is a mutual safety pool prefunfunded mainly by all CCP members and partially by investor) → 3. CCP capital (" Skin in the game") → 4. Mutualized default fund (pool prefunded by all CCP's members used after the CCP's skin)→ 5. Assesment(additional calls on surviving members) → 6.Recovery / wind-down tools 


  *below the default waterfall process*,
  
  ```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Defaulter margin] --> B[DF slice] --> C[CCP skin] --> D[Mutual DF] --> E[Assessments] --> F[Recovery] --> G[Wind down]
```

- **CSD / Demat (Central Securities Depository)**: The market’s electronic vault and ledger for securities. It records ownership and moves securities at settlement via DvP( =simultaneous exchange, shares to buyer, cash to seller, in one linked settlement). Only participants (brokers, custodians, CCPs) have CSD accounts. Investors hold demat accounts(dematerialized securities account) through their broker/custodian(bank or specialist firm that safekeeps investor's securities that operates demat account). The CSD also routes corporate actions (dividends, splits, rights, proxies).
  
  
- **Regulator:** Sets the rules, licenses and supervises participants, and enforces fair, orderly, transparent markets with investor protection.
In IPOs: the regulator reviews and approves the offering document, declares a registration effective (US) or approves the prospectus (UK/EU) while the exchange separately decides on listing/admission.


*Key Intermediaries by Hub* (quick reference)

<h4><ins>Market Access &amp; Account Setup</ins></h4>

- (1)DMA via broker (most common): You are not an exchange member; you use the broker’s membership/infrastructure with mandatory pre-trade risk checks (limits, controls).

- (2)DMA as a member: You become an exchange member yourself (costly; capital/technology/compliance requirements). Used by hedge funds, prop desks, and large institutions.

      Advantages : Lower latency, fine grained control (routing, order type) and execution transparency.
      Constraints : Technical requirements, pre-trade risk control(automatic checks applied before your order
      reaches the exchange, to stop bad or dangerous orders, these action add friction, cost and limits even though
      they are necessary), compliance and higher fixed cost. 
      
When an investor opens a brokerage account, the broker also sets up a demat/custody account for the investor with (or through) a CSD participant. The top-level CSD account is held by the CSD participant (e.g., the broker/custodian/bank), not by the retail investor or a typical small trading firm.

(Exception: only firms that become direct CSD participants hold their own CSD accounts.)

<h4><ins>Trading Workflow (End-to-End)</ins></h4>

1. **Order placement:** You place a buy/sell order with your broker (price, quantity, order type).
2. **Routing & execution:** The broker forwards the order to the exchange, where it is matched against opposing orders—this is the **execution**.
3. **Clearing:** A clearing member reports the trade to the clearing house, which **nets** obligations and manages risk between counterparties.
4. **Settlement:** On settlement date, **cash** moves to the seller and **securities** move to the buyer’s **Demat/CSD** account; books and records are updated.

<h4><ins>Investor Touchpoints</ins></h4>

As an investor, you typically **interact only with your broker** for onboarding, funding, order entry, confirmations, and statements. The exchange, clearing house, and CSD work **behind the scenes**, so the end to end process often appears like a black box.

<h4><ins>Regulator’s Role</ins></h4>

The regulator defines market rules, licensing and conduct standards, disclosure requirements, and surveillance mechanisms. It aims to ensure **fair, orderly, and efficient markets** and **protect investors** through oversight and enforcement.

<h4><ins>Takeaways</ins></h4>

- A completed trade relies on **multiple intermediaries**, not just the exchange.  
- **Access paths:** Direct Market Acces (DMA) for members vs. DMA via **broker** for most investors.  
- **Finality:** Clearing and CSD/Demat custody are essential to move cash and update ownership safely.

# 10. Inside the Broker: Types, Services & Best Execution

Brokers are separate from exchanges. They connect you to the market, handle your account, and route your orders. Most traders (retail and many small institutions) use brokers because it is simpler and cheaper than being an exchange member.
The broker is the first link in the chain between investor's order and the market. It **connects the investor to trading venues,handles account, routes orders to venues (fills) and returns execution report(confirmation)** 

Choosing the right broker is critical as it can have a substantial impact on the trading journey.

<h4><ins> Broker Types</ins></h4>


- **Retail / Discount broker :** A retail(discount) broker focuses on execution and self directed trading (web,mobile,desktop,API) rather than advice. Their price offer tend to be low (zero comission) however, they charge the spread, data access, and the margin interest.
  
  The order type are basics, market/limit/stop ; they offer cash or margin account ; Orders are routed to venues or Market Maker (wholesalers) with pre trade risk check(cash/margin avaibility, size, fat finger, compliance) 
  
  *Who uses it:* retail traders, small LLCs.  
  *Pros:* cheaper, fast onboarding.
  *Cons:* little or no advice.

- **Full-service broker :**  this type of broker provides advices and recommendations, access to research, trading on behalf of a trader, and portfolio/wealth management (asset allocation, tax/estate/retirement planning). It offers more hands-on support (human advisor, discretionary mandates, goal-based plans). Their prices are higher than retail/discount. They apply single trade commissions, advisory fee and charge for the platform.
  
Execution & routing: can route to exchanges/venues or MM ; pre-trade risk checks still apply.

*Who uses it:* investors who want guidance or delegation (busy professionals, families, small institutions).
*Pros:* tailored advice, behavioral coaching, curated access, admin handled.
*Cons:* costly, potential conflicts (product shelves/revenue sharing), less DIY focus.
    

- **Broker-dealer (can internalize) :** This broker is also a dealer. It can internalizes meaning execute your order against its own book (fill from its own inventory/quote; called principal trade) and become the counterparty or route it to venues (Agency trade). When it internalizes, it may give price improvement (better than the quoted price) and very fast fills. Revenues come from spread capture, maker–taker fees/rebates, and Pay For Order Flow (PFOF); agency commissions may also apply. Conflicts must be managed (best-execution duty, disclosures, routing reports). Indeed, if the broker-dealer decide to internalize, it must give a result at least as good as routing externally. 

Hedging : Even if it fills you internally, the broker-dealer will often hedge its position on an exchange/ MTF/ATS or with another market maker after your trade. Furthermore, if the broker-dealer doesn't want the risk, lacks inventory or quotes, or internalizations wouldn't meet its best expectation

  *Who uses it:* both retail (via wholesaler models) and institutions (high-touch or algo/SOR flow).    
  *Pros:* potential price improvement, fast fills. *Cons:* conflicts to manage; disclosures.

- **Prime broker (institutional) :** A prime broker (PB) is an institutional broker that provides the infrastructure and balance sheet a fund needs to trade at scale. The PB finances positions & margin (credit line; cross-margin across cash/futures/swaps; haircuts on position)
  
Execution : Fund trades via multiple executing brokers/algos/venues. The fills are then give up to the PB for clear(novate trade)/custody(holding and safeguarding customer's securities to prevent damage,loss or theft)/financing

  *Who uses it:* hedge funds, prop firms, active family offices needing leverage, shorting, custody, and operational scale.    
  *Pros:* end to end service + balance-sheet. *Cons:* high minimums, complex agreements.

- **Introducing broker (IB) :**  An IB brings clients and provides the front-end service (onboarding, platform/help). It does not hold client assets or clear trades. Instead, orders are routed to the clearing broker(also called carrying broker). This carrying broker also handles execution, clearing, custody. IB earns introducing commission, clearing earns by charging for execution, clearing and custody then pays back the introducing broker depending of their agreement.

*Who uses it:* Client who want local services, small brokers or fintech who want to launch quickly.
 *Pros:* local service, lower setup. *Cons:* relies on another firm for execution/custody.

- **White-label broker :**  A white label broker operates under its own brand but on another broker’s technology, license, and infrastructure. The underlying provider handles all the technical services. The white label broker is in charge of branding, client acquisition and front-end (often with limited customization).
  
  *Who uses it:* fintechs, startups that want to launch fast without building full brokerage infrastructure.
  *Pros:* quick to launch.
  *Cons:* dependency on the underlying provider.

- **Execution-only / Agency broker :**  Acts strictly as an agent, focuses on best execution and smart order routing (SOR) across exchanges, Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), dark pools (venue where pre trade quote are hidden to reduce market impact). No involvent in research or investment advice. Does not trade against customer (no principal/internalization).

  *Who uses it:* institutions and sophisticated clients who want low conflicts, advanced routing/algos, and price/venue expertise.
  *Pros:* low conflicts, price/venue expertise. *Cons:* limited extras.

- **Custody-only (custodian bank):** It holds your securities at the CSD/ICSD through the bank’s participant accounts.
It sends DvP settlement instructions, manages fails, and moves cash.
It processes corporate actions (dividends, splits, rights issues, proxy voting) and handles tax reclaims/withholding.

*Who uses it:* Funds, asset managers, family offices that want strong asset protection and industrial-grade ops, while using a separate executing broker for trades.

  *Pros:* Robust asset protection. *Cons:* need a separate executing broker

<h4><ins> Market Access</ins></h4>

**- DMA via broker (most common):**  With Direct Market Acess (DMA) via broker , the customer are not an exchange member; it use the broker’s membership/infrastructure with mandatory pre-trade risk checks (limits, controls).
  
**- Venue connectivity (exchanges, MTFs, dark/ATS) :** Brokers connect to multiple lit venue (exchange and MTFs) or dark pools and in EU/EK sometimes SIs (dealer quote streams).
More venues = more liquidity sources and better routing choices but also more complexity, more fees.
  
**- Smart Order Router (SOR) basics :** A Smart Oder Router (SOR) is and algorithmic system that decide where/when to send order accros lit venue, MTF or darkpool to get the best route with the overall outcome. In other word, it seeks the best route by balancing price, fees/rebates, speed/ latency and likelihood of fill 

<h4><ins> Fees & Revenue</ins></h4>

**- Commissions/fees; maker–taker rebates/fees :** Per-order or per-share **commissions**, plus venue **fees/rebates** (maker–taker, taker–maker, auction fees). Many brokers **pass through** exchange/clearing costs; some add small **markups**.


**- Payment for Order Flow (where allowed) ** : Order flow sold to wholesaler, Market Maker. Broker may also receives a rebate for routing retail order.
  
**- Interest on cash/margin; FX/ops fees :** Net interest on **idle cash** and **margin loans**; **FX conversion spreads**; operational fees (wire/withdrawal, custody/settlement pass-throughs, marketdata plans).


**- Securities lending revenue share :** Revenue from lending out fully-paid or margin securities to short sellers. Some brokers share a portion with clients.


<h4><ins> Best Execution & Routing</ins></h4>

**- Price, likelihood of fill, speed, costs (holistic best-ex) :** “Best execution” means the broker seeks the **best overall outcome** (generally through SOR). The strategy depends on customer **instructions** (urgent vs patient, lit-only vs allow dark).


**- High-level routing disclosures/policies :** Brokers publish how they route orders (venues used, use of dark/SIs/wholesalers, internalization) and provide post-trade reports (where your order filled, timestamps). Policies explain when they post vs take, try midpoint/dark, or split across venues, and how fees/rebates and conflicts are handled all within their best execution framework.


<h4><ins> Key Takeaways</ins></h4>
- Broker = access + routing + safekeeping (directly or via custodian)  
- Your cost = spread + fees + slippage; know routing and risk controls

<h4><ins>Process: Order via Broker</ins></h4>

# 12. Inside the Customer Securities Depository (CSD): Safekeeping, DvP Settlement & Asset Servicing

CSDs are the core posttrade infrastructure: they safekeep dematerialized securities; ensure Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) settlement so that cash and securities move simultaneously; and perform asset servicing such as dividends, coupons, rights and proxy voting   

<ins> **CSD**: </ins>

CSD is a market infrastructure that maintains and keeps safe the securities accounts, settles transfers in **DvP**, and provides **asset servicing** (coupons, dividends, rights, voting, splits).
Many countries have one domestic CSD traditionally associated with the National Stock Exchange
  
<ins> **ICSD :** </ins>  

International CSD focused on international instruments (notably **Eurobonds**) ( **Euroclear Bank** and **Clearstream Banking S.A.**). ICSDs are based in Europe but operates worldwide. Although headquartered in Europe, the two ICSDs Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking S.A. grew out of the Eurobond market. Today they provide global settlement, custody, and collateral services for a broad set of international instruments, not just Eurobonds.
  
***ICSDs matter for Eurobonds because they provide a single international hub to issue, safekeep, and settle cross border bonds, offering multi-currency DvP, links to domestic CSDs so issuers reach global investors and investors move collateral efficiently.***

*"Eurobond A bond issued outside the home jurisdiction of its currency and offered to investors across multiple international markets (the “euro” refers to the offshore euromarket, not Europe or the euro). Eurobonds are typically  and settled/cleared via ICSDs such as Euroclear and Clearstream"

  
<ins> **Dematerialization / Rematerialization :** </ins> 

Converting paper certificates into electronic records; today, most major markets operate in demat form.

  *Why dematerialization ?* : Dematerialization accelerates settlement, reduces handling and transport risks, and lowers operational errors tied to lost or forged certificates.


  
<ins>**DvP (Delivery-versus-Payment) :** </ins> 

Securities delivered iff cash is paid.

***Simply put, DvP is a settlement mechanism that links the cash and securities legs so neither becomes final unless the other does. This eliminates principal risk.***
   
   -> All the DvP models apply the simple rules of No Cash,No Shares / No Shares,No Cash.

*Below the 3 BIS(Bank for International Settlements) model and their consequences.*
   
  - **Model 1**, **gross** securities + **gross** cash (trade by trade) : Each matched instruction settled individually. The engine checks you have the securities and the cash right now. If yes → settle; if not → park & recycle. With this model we need highest intraday liquidity on both side, the risk profile is considered minimal.

    *Who loves it : Risk controllers and central bank*


    *Who complains : Treasury and desk with thin intraday lines(because cash is required instantally)*
    
     
  - **Model 2**: **gross** securities + **net** cash : The securities are received/delivered instruction by instruction while cash is settled on a net basis at defined intervals (eg, at the end of the day). In this model, we need lower cash liquidity compared to model 1 but the same securities liquidity is needed (we must have the line by line inventory to deliver). Here the risk profil is considered also minimal with nuance. Indeed we must have the net cash at cutoff and operational issues can still cause fails or penalties.

  *Who loves it : Treasury and cash management teams because of lower intraday cash usage ; Desk with high volume in equities and fixed income that do both buy and sell intraday.* 

  
  *Who complains : Risk compliance teams remain cautious because cash settles on a net basis at defined windows, creating a funding pressure at cut-off, potential settlement-discipline penalties if funding fails ; traders relying on just-in-time inventory ; Participants with irregular one side flows (mostly buys or mostly sells) who see little cash netting relief.*

    
  - **Model 3**: **net** securities + **net** cash (batch) : During the day, trades are captured but not individually settled. At the batch window, the system multilaterally nets all participants's trade. We have here lowest liquidity need because we fund at only the nets. Regarding the risk, if one payer can't fund at the batch window, the batch can jam (systemic settlement risk) unless supported by guarantees (prefunding, CCP)
    
 *Who loves it : Treasury and cash teams (minimal cash usage) ; Market operators handling massive ticket volumes; Back-office teams (fewer payments to process)*

 
 *Who complains it : Risk/Compliance on batch dependency (failure of a big payer can jam the cycle); Participants with directional one-sided flows (limited netting benefit), and counterparties facing tight cut ouioffs without robust prefunding lines.*

*Below worked examples of model 1 / 2 / 3*

| Case | Timeline | What happens | Cash movement | Liquidity impact | Risk/notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A) Model 1  | 10:15 buy €200m; 11:00 sell €200m | Each trade settles immediately (gross/gross) | Cash leaves at 10:15 for the buy; sale cash arrives at 11:00 (no offset) | High intraday funding (no netting) | Needs pre-funding or intraday credit; potential gridlock if funding tight |
| B) Model 2  | Same trades | Securities settle gross; cash nets at 17:00 | One net cash at window (buys offset sells) | Medium (cash compressed; securities still line-by-line) | Funding pressure at cut-off; settlement-discipline penalties if funding fails |
| C) Model 3 — batch efficiency | 100 small two-way equity tickets | Multilateral netting; batch DvP on nets | One net cash + net per ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) | Low (max netting) | Batch can stall if a big net payer can’t fund; mitigants: CCP guarantees, prefunding, loss-allocation |



 <ins>**Asset servicing :** <ins> 
 
 CSD covers the full corporate action lifecycle, capturing event terms, allocating entitlements, handling elections for rights issues, and supporting proxy voting. Many CSDs also support pledging/collateral management, blocking securities against credit lines or CCP margin calls.
