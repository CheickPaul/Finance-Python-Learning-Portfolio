####  An Introduction to Probability & Statistics

<ins>An Introduction to Probability & Statistics</ins>

we encounter data everywhere in our society. Org takes decision based on data. (better judgment under uncertainty)


<ins>What is Statistics?</ins>

science whichi deals with collection, organisation, analysing, interpretion and presentation of data to support decision making. It helps decision makers in making informed decision 

could be split in 2 main field **Descriptif stat (summarizing and visualisation of data)** and **Inferential statistics (draw conclusion about a population from a sample)**

<ins>Probability vs. Statistics (clear contrast)</ins>

also study together it remains a difference between both of them.

*proba* :Start with a model → ask “what is the chance this event happens?” 

Concerned with calculating the likelihood of an event to occuring ang it. "

Ex: “What is the probability daily return < −2% if returns are normal?”

Generally calculated before the even takes place.

*statistic* : start with data → ask “what does the data say about the model/parameters?”

comes into play once the event has taken place.

Ex: “Using 3 years of returns, what is the volatility (σ) and its confidence interval?”


| **Topic**     | **Before/After**         | **Typical Question**                     | **Example (markets)**                         |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Probability   | Before seeing outcome     | How likely is event **E**?                | Chance of **stop-loss** being hit tomorrow    |
| Statistics    | After observing data      | What are the parameters? Is **alpha** real? | Estimated **Sharpe**, test if **alpha ≠ 0** |



**4.practical application of statistic**
we see stat accross many field such as medicine( predict the presence of a disease in a patient) ; economy ( analyze relationship between economic measures such as GDP and unemployement rate) ; business (to study past trends of customer behaviour; A/B test) ; insurance ( to calculate the risk presented by the insured client or property- insurance premium is directly proportional to the risk posed by the insured) ; 

**Finance (sell-side & buy-side)** : to evaluate risks and returns for stocks ; portfolio optimisation, risk management, credit modeling, trading strategy formulation.

- **Risk management:** estimate VaR (Value at Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall).

- **Portfolio:** optimize mean–variance; estimate beta (market sensitivity).

- **Credit:** model PD/LGD/EAD (probability of default, loss given default, exposure).

- **Trading:** build & test signals; measure alpha (excess return) vs noise.



<ins>Statistics in Quant Finance & Algorithmic Trading (desk-friendly)</ins>

- **Signal discovery:** is a pattern real or just **noise**? (use p-values, out-of-sample tests).

- **Parameter estimation:** mean return, **volatility, autocorrelation, cross-correlation** (lead/lag).

- **Backtesting:** **in-sample** fit vs **out-of-sample** performance; avoid **overfitting**.

-**Execution:** estimate **slippage** (execution shortfall), **market impact, fill probability.**

- **Risk:** scenario & **stress tests** (2008, 2020), regime shifts.

- **Monitoring:** production **drift** (live stats ≠ backtest stats), breaks in correlation.

<ins>Trader vocab (with short hints)</ins>

**Alpha** (excess return), **beta** (market sensitivity), **vol** (volatility), **drawdown** (peak-to-trough loss), **Sharpe** (return per unit risk), **VaR/ES** (tail risk), **slippage** (execution shortfall), **fill rate** (execution probability).
