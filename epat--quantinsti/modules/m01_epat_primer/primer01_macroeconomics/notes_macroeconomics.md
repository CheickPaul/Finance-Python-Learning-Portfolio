1. # ***Economics***
   Economics is the study of human behaviour and decision making.
   Economic can be split in 2 branches. Microeconomic and Macroeconomics. Micro one focuses on how individuals and firms buy and sell good and services
   
   The opportunity cost, is a very important concept in economic. It,s the second best option
   *Opportunity Cost=Return of Best Foregone Option − Return of Chosen Option*
   eg :
   
      a)You decide to enroll in a full-time program (like EPAT) for six months.You spend €5,000 on          tuition. But during the same period, you could have worked and earned €15,000.
      ➡️ Your total opportunity cost = €5,000 + €15,000 = €20,000 (tuition cost + foregone income).

      b)A farmer can use his field to: grow corn (expected profit €5,000), or grow wheat (expected          profit €6,000).
      ➡️ If he chooses to grow corn, the opportunity cost is €6,000, the profit he would have               earned from producing wheat.

      c)You have €10,000 to invest.
      Option A: buy a bond ETF yielding 4% per year (low risk).
      Option B: actively trade the Nasdaq, expecting 10% per year.
      If your trading returns only 3%, your opportunity cost is 4%, the return you could have             earned without taking additional risk.

In trading, your opportunity cost isn’t just financial, it also includes the time, energy, and focus you could have allocated to more efficient or higher probability strategies.

2. # ***The demand and supply curves***
   A market is the interaction between buyers and sellers for a specific good or service. The market demand is set buy the buyers and the market supply is set buy the sellers. We have 2 types of market. Organized market (centralized and regulated) : Stock exchange, futures markets)
Unorganized market (Decentralized, OTC trading)

## The demand curve and its inputs
Each time the consumer has to buy something he faces the decision of how many goods or service to buy. The " how much to buy" is called " the quantity demanded". 
Now let's think about what determine the quantity demanded. We have many reason more that only the price.
The more **income** you have, the higher quantity you demand of any good or service. The more you **prefer(preference)** the good, the higher quantity you demand of that good. The higher your **expectations** of the good’s quality, the higher quantity you demand of that good. **Substitute goods**: If you see an increase in the price of Californian apples, you might decide to buy
Kashmiri apples which have lower prices. **Complementary goods**: If you see an increase in paper prices, then you might prefer to read books on your computer and decide not to buy a printer, so you reduce the quantity demanded of printers. The higher the **expectations** of the overall economy, the more the buyer will spend his income on
goods and services because he expects more income to generate

<img width="1052" height="134" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e02a128-501c-4c17-80b9-b64397a1c280" /> 

## The demand curve graph
<img width="918" height="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9df6c1-8e3b-4628-94ad-9fdf00e6bfdd" />
the demand curve has a downward slope, the higher the price, the lesser the quantity demanded ( if we assume that the others variables maintain constant).
This negative relationship is maintained in almost all goods, that's why economist call this phenomenon the "law of demand". Exceptions to this law include the veblen goods (a subset of luxury goods)



   **Endogenous variables** : Price (P), Quantity (Qd) 
   → Variables explained by the model
   
   **Exogenous variables** : Individual preference, Substitute goods, complementary goods etc →             → Variables serving as input to explain a model

 ## Movement along the demand curve (when price changes)

On the graph, axes are P (price) and Q (quantity).

If only price changes (all else equal), we move along the same demand curve D.

Price ↑ → Quantity demanded ↓ (you move up/left along D).

Price ↓ → Quantity demanded ↑ (you move down/right along D).

The curve itself doesn’t move, only your point on the curve changes.

Mental picture: the road stays the same (curve D); you just change your position on that road.

## Shift of the demand curve (when an external factor changes)

If a factor other than price changes (preferences, income, prices of substitutes/complements, number of buyers, expectations, etc.), the entire demand curve shifts.

Rightward shift (D → D″): higher demand at every price.

Examples: income ↑ for a normal good; preferences ↑; substitute’s price ↑; more buyers.

Leftward shift (D → D′): lower demand at every price.

Examples: income ↓ (normal good); preferences ↓; complement’s price ↑; expectations of lower future prices.

Mental picture: you switch to a different road (from D to D′ or D″). At the same price, the desired quantity is no longer the same.

 Reading the diagram (on your page)

The middle curve is D (baseline).

D″ (further right) = higher demand at each price → rightward shift.

D′ (further left) = lower demand → leftward shift.

These shifts come from exogenous variables (not on the axes), so they move the curve rather than slide you along it.

## Markets/Trading translation

Movement along: intraday price changes that attract/repel buyers without a fundamental change.

Shift: macro news/sentiment changes (monetary policy, taxes, regulation, innovation) → at every price level, there are structurally more or fewer buyers.

Trick to never mix them up

Price changes ⇒ you move along D.

Something else changes ⇒ D moves. (preferences, income, substitutes/complements, expectations, number of buyers, …)

## The supply curve
Let's say we want to sell fish to supermarkets. In this case, we will face 2 decisions "how much to sell ?" and " what price to assign to your good?". this 2 things are embedded in what economist called the quantity supplied.

## The supply curve and its inputs
<img width="878" height="178" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fae8380-e242-43b6-a4e2-e954fdd145fa" />

## The supply curve graph

This time, our supply curve has an upward slope, i.e., the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied.
This positive relationship is maintained in almost all goods, that’s why economists call this phenomenon the “law of supply”

 **Endogenous variables** : Price (P), Quantity supplied (Qs)
   → Variables explained by the model
   
   **Exogenous variables** : input costs, technology, taxes, capacity, expectations, supply shocks, financing,...
   → Variables serving as input to explain a model

  Qs =S(P∣input costs, technology, taxes, capacity, expectations, supply shocks, financing,…)

  ## Movement along the supply curve (when the good’s price changes)

Axes: P (price) and Q (quantity).

If only the product’s price changes (ceteris paribus), you move along the same supply curve S.

Price ↑ → producers supply more (move up/right along S).

Price ↓ → producers supply less.

The curve itself doesn’t move—only your point on S changes.

Mental picture: the road is the same (curve S); you just change your position on that road.


## Shift of the supply curve (when an external factor changes)

If a factor other than the product’s price changes (input costs, technology, taxes/regulation, logistics/weather, number of producers, expectations), the entire supply curve shifts.

Rightward shift (S → S″): more supply at every price.

Examples: lower input costs (energy, raw materials), tech improvements, better logistics, subsidies.

Leftward shift (S → S′): less supply at every price.

Examples: higher input costs, new taxes/regulations, supply disruptions, adverse weather.

Mental picture: you switch to a different road (from S to S′ or S″). At the same price, the offered quantity changes.

 Reading your diagram

S = baseline.

S″ (further right) = greater supply at a given price → rightward shift.

S′ (further left) = lower supply → leftward shift.

Shifts come from exogenous variables (not on the axes), so they move the curve rather than slide you along it.

4) Quick concrete example

Wheat price unchanged.

Fertilizer prices fall (an input) → production is cheaper → supply ↑ → S shifts right (S → S″).

Carbon tax introduced on farm machinery → costs ↑ → supply ↓ → S shifts left (S → S′).


## Markets/Trading translation

Movement along: spot/futures price changes lead market makers/producers to tweak quantities without structural change.

Shift: a fundamental change in costs/capacity (OPEC quota change, refinery outage, new regulation) alters supply at every price—order-book depth on the ask thickens or thins across multiple levels.

Rule to remember:

Price of the good changes ⇒ move along S.

Anything else changes (inputs, tech, taxes, capacity, logistics) ⇒ S shifts.

## Equilibrium (P*, Q*)
<img width="836" height="696" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f75249-0a2f-4a89-82fe-4b6f975aff7e" />

In equilibrium, we have the best price P* where buyers and sellers agree on the quantity demanded and the supplied called Q*. 

### Surplus,Excess supply ( P"> P*)  and shortage, price too loww ( P'< P*)

### Surplus (Excess Supply) at (P'' > P^*)

At price **(P'')** (above the market price (P^*)):

* **Quantity supplied:** (Q'') — producers want to sell a lot at the high price.
* **Quantity demanded:** (Q') — buyers purchase little because it’s expensive.

**Therefore:** Q_S > Q_D ; then Surplus (inventories build up).

**Adjustment mechanism:** to clear inventories, sellers cut price,  **downward pressure** back toward (P^*).

**On the chart:** the **top green rectangle** shows this **excess supply** between (Q') and (Q'') at price (P'').

**Market intuition:** too many **asks**, not enough **bids**, sellers **chase buyers** by lowering prices.

Here’s the matching **README-style Markdown** for **Shortage (Excess Demand)**:

---

### Shortage (Excess Demand) at (P' < P^*)

At price **(P')** (below the market price (P^*)):

* **Quantity demanded:** (Q'') — buyers want a lot because it’s cheap.
* **Quantity supplied:** (Q') — producers offer little; not profitable at this price.

**Therefore:** Q_D > Q_S ;then Shortage (stockouts, queues).

**Adjustment mechanism:** buyers compete and sellers raise price, **upward pressure** back toward (P^*).

**On the chart:** the **bottom green rectangle** shows this **excess demand** between (Q') and (Q'') at price (P').

**Market intuition:** too many **bids**, not enough **asks**, buyers **chase the price** upward.

## Concepts Applied in Trading — Endogenous vs. Exogenous

> **Legend:** **[ENDOGENOUS]** = determined within the market for the asset (auction/microstructure).
> **[EXOGENOUS]** = comes from outside the market; shifts supply/demand at every price.

---

### 1) Why does a price rise/fall?

Multiple forces can shift demand or supply:

* **Macro expectations** (growth, inflation, Fed) — **[EXOGENOUS]**
  → more/less buyers at every price (**demand shift**).

* **Investor income/savings** (flows into equities/ETFs) — **[EXOGENOUS]**
  → higher purchasing power → **demand ↑**.

* **Technology / market access** (better connectivity, lower fees) — **[EXOGENOUS]**
  → participation ↑ → liquidity ↑; prices may rise if flows are buyer-heavy.

> Curve reading: these are **shifts** (not movements along the curve).

---

### 2) Commodity futures: know the underlying

Factors that shift **supply (S)** and drive calendar spreads / cost of carry (contango/backwardation):

* **Input costs** (energy, raw materials) — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Inventories / stocks** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Seasonality** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Production capacity** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Logistics / weather** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Regulation, taxes, quotas, OPEC decisions** — **[EXOGENOUS]**

---

### 3) Equity–bond link

* **Growth/earnings expectations** — **[EXOGENOUS]** for a given stock.
* **Rates / yield curve / cost of capital** — **[EXOGENOUS]** (macro drivers).

> Equities and bonds “talk” to each other through these **exogenous** variables.

---

### 4) More retail traders → buy pressure

* **Number of participants / retail inflows** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
  (shifts **demand** and the **supply of liquidity**).
* **Higher volatility, bid/ask queues** — **[ENDOGENOUS]** (microstructure outcome).

---

### 5) More investors ⇒ more competitive market

* **Competition, tick size, fees, frictions** — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Tighter spreads, compressed alpha** — **[ENDOGENOUS]** (auction result).
* **Need for stronger processes** (data, execution, risk) — **[ENDOGENOUS]** strategic response.

---

### 6) Fundamentals matter

* **Earnings, cash flows, leverage, market share, management quality** — **[EXOGENOUS]** to the secondary market.
* **Price converging toward value** over time — **[ENDOGENOUS]** (market reaction to exogenous fundamentals).

---

### 7) Higher price ≠ better value

* **Flows / euphoria / sentiment** (not tied to fundamentals) — **[EXOGENOUS]**
* **Price–value gap (“mispricing”)** — **[ENDOGENOUS]** (produced by the auction given valuation inputs).

3. # Gross domestic product
   The most used metric in economics. it's defined as the market value of all final goods and services          produced within a country in a given period of time.
   <img width="1382" height="492" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9e88f3-19b5-43c8-b7bd-631ff3ff368b" />

## 3 ways to compute GDP
      1) The income approach : 𝐺𝐷𝑃 = 𝜋 + 𝜔 + 𝑖 + 𝜏
      <img width="862" height="226" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48e5343c-1455-4c19-8878-4b0637658c83" />

      2) The value added approach : GDP is the sum of value added created at each stage of production in the economy.
      Firm-level value added (VA) 
VA=Value of Output (sales)−Intermediate Inputs
GDP = sum of VA across all firms.
We use this approach to avoid double counting.

      3) Expenditure Approach to GDP : GDP is the sum of final spending by households, firms, and government, plus net exports
      GDP=C+I+G+(X−M)
<img width="1200" height="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cad806a0-426d-4853-aa08-8b683f17012d" />
whatever method you use, you should obtain the same value as a result.

## Real versus Nominal GDP
Nominal we use quantity X current prices
Real we use the price of the base year. ( base year price)

The GDP deflator :

The GDP deflator rate of growth from one period to the next one is called the inflation rate
Inflation of yeart
