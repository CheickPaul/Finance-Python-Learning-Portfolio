1. # ***Economics***
   Economics is the study of human behaviour and decision making.
   Economic can be split in 2 branches. Microeconomic and Macroeconomics. Micro one focuses on how individuals and firms buy and sell good and services
   
   The opportunity cost, is a very important concept in economic. It,s the second best option
   *Opportunity Cost=Return of Best Foregone Option − Return of Chosen Option*
   eg :
   
   a)You decide to enroll in a full-time program (like EPAT) for six months.You spend €5,000 on tuition. But during the same period, you could have worked and earned €15,000.
   ➡️ Your total opportunity cost = €5,000 + €15,000 = €20,000 (tuition cost + foregone income).

   b)A farmer can use his field to: grow corn (expected profit €5,000), or grow wheat (expected profit €6,000).
➡️ If he chooses to grow corn, the opportunity cost is €6,000, the profit he would have earned from producing wheat.

c)You have €10,000 to invest.
Option A: buy a bond ETF yielding 4% per year (low risk).
Option B: actively trade the Nasdaq, expecting 10% per year.
If your trading returns only 3%, your opportunity cost is 4%, the return you could have earned without taking additional risk.

In trading, your opportunity cost isn’t just financial, it also includes the time, energy, and focus you could have allocated to more efficient or higher probability strategies.

2. # ***The demand and supply curves***
   A market is the interaction between buyers and sellers for a specific good or service. The market demand is set buy the buyers and the market supply is set buy the sellers. We have 2 types of market. Organized market (centralized and regulated) : Stock exchange, futures markets)
Unorganized market (Decentralized, OTC trading)

## The demand curve
Each time the consumer has to buy something he faces the decision of how many goods or service to buy. The " how much to buy" is called " the quantity demanded". 
Now let's think about what determine the quantity demanded. We have many reason more that only the price.
The more **income** you have, the higher quantity you demand of any good or service. The more you **prefer(preference)** the good, the higher quantity you demand of that good. The higher your **expectations** of the good’s quality, the higher quantity you demand of that good. **Substitute goods**: If you see an increase in the price of Californian apples, you might decide to buy
Kashmiri apples which have lower prices. **Complementary goods**: If you see an increase in paper prices, then you might prefer to read books on your computer and decide not to buy a printer, so you reduce the quantity demanded of printers. The higher the **expectations** of the overall economy, the more the buyer will spend his income on
goods and services because he expects more income to generate
